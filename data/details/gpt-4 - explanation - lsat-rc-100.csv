","Thought: 
The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education, which advocates for a neutral stance on cultural values but still uses Western methods of examination. Critics of this version argue that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is distorting and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. Therefore, proponents of this version would most likely object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.

  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.

The author connects increased size with monopoly power by arguing that larger businesses can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller businesses, driving smaller firms out of business and leading to monopoly. To undermine this connection, we need to find a choice that challenges the idea that increased size necessarily leads to monopoly power.

The author discusses the twofold obligation of defense lawyers: to the defendant and to the court/society. The author believes that lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, nor should they try to prove the innocence of a client they believe to be guilty. Instead, they should present the case in the client's favor and argue for leniency if they believe it is warranted. This suggests that the author is confident that this twofold obligation enables defense lawyers to balance their competing responsibilities to the court and to society.
