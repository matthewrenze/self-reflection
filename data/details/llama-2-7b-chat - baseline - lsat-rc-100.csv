  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
","  The correct answer is (D): Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

The author of passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a ""conspiracy theory"" because it implies that an individual's actions are motivated by an interest in promoting the proliferation of their genes, even if the individual is not consciously aware of this interest. The author suggests that this explanation is problematic because it is difficult to determine whether a particular behavior is truly motivated by an interest in genetic self-propagation, as there may be other, equally valid reasons for the behavior.

The passage highlights the example of altruism, where an individual expends valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual. The author argues that this behavior could have evolved because genes promoting identification and empathy increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of those genes. However, the author suggests that this explanation is not sufficient to prove that an individual's actions are truly motivated by an interest in genetic self-propagation, as there may be other reasons for the behavior as well.

","  The correct answer is (D): Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

The passage explains that the traditional theory of electrical signaling in the brain is no longer tenable, and that chemical signals are now believed to play a crucial role in transmitting electrical impulses between neurons. The author provides evidence for this theory by describing the structure of receptors for neurotransmitters, which contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a channel for ions. The author also notes that different varieties of these receptors exist in different parts of the brain, which raises the possibility of selective treatment of brain disorders through drugs targeted to specific receptors.

Choices (A) and (B) are partially correct, but they oversimplify the main point of the passage.

The author's attitude towards the twofold obligation introduced in lines 20-23 is that it does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers. The author acknowledges that defense lawyers have a duty to the court and to society, but also to their clients. The author believes that defense lawyers should not present false or insincere arguments, even if they know their clients are guilty. Instead, they should appraise the case in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and present any extenuating circumstances to argue for leniency in sentencing. The author emphasizes that the best defense can only be provided by an advocate who is convinced of the merits of the case, and that defense lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for their clients but instead advocates for their rights.

This allows the business to produce more goods or services at a lower cost than smaller competitors, which can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly. The example of the bee colony illustrates this concept by showing how the colony can increase its productivity by specializing certain bees to guard nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar and feed a larger colony.

The passage provides a detailed analysis of Roy Lichtenstein's work and the context in which it was created, with a focus on the artist's motivations and intentions. The author explains how Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and how his use of comic-art conventions was intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in the art world. The passage also highlights the artist's faith in reconciliation between different art forms and his desire to depict contemporary life in his work.

","  The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that option (C) is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

According to the principle of utility maximization, an individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility. However, in option (C), the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, which means that the expected utility from illegal discharge is higher than the expected utility from treatment.

In option (A), the waiter is attempting to reduce his taxes by concealing a portion of his tip income, which is a rational response to the economic incentive of avoiding taxes.

The primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52-54) is to serve as the author's logical conclusion from the data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development. The author argues that entrepreneurs and investors often cannot maximize their financial success without expanding their market, which involves structuring their prices to make their technologies accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. This leads to a tendency for prices to be driven down, which in turn diffuses access to new technology across society. Therefore, the reference to maximization of financial success is used to support the author's argument that technological development has served as a democratizing force in society, narrowing the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people in the long term.",,B,D,0,1053,183,1236,

The passage explains that for centuries, wine has been thought to have healthful effects, despite the assumption that wine, like other alcoholic beverages, only contains alcohol as its active ingredient. The author cites recent research that challenges this assumption and investigates the effects of moderate wine consumption. The author highlights the findings of these studies, which show that wine consumption has a slower absorption rate than other alcoholic beverages, and that deaths due to premature heart disease in certain European countries decreased as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. The author suggests that these effects may be due to the presence of certain natural compounds in grapes, which are not found in other alcoholic beverages.

The passage explains that the first proposal for promoting multicultural understanding, which involves teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture, is criticized because it refracts the study of other cultures through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. The second proposal, which involves adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, is also criticized because it relies on Western scientific methods that are value-laden and may not be appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures.

The passage suggests that the second version of multicultural education is flawed because it relies on Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures, which are value-laden and may not be applicable to these cultures. The objection raised in the passage is that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden, and the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values, such as objectivity.

Option (C) supports this objection by suggesting that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.

The purpose of passage B is to criticize the type of argument made in passage A by attempting to create an analogous argument with a conclusion that is clearly false. The author of passage B argues that the type of evidence used in passage A is often derived from inaccurate observation, and that the claims made in passage A are vacuous because no possible evidence could confirm or disconfirm them. The author of passage B seeks to undermine the type of argument made in passage A by suggesting that it relies on questionable reasoning. Therefore, the best answer is (B)",,B,E,0,1182,130,1312,

  D: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to increase if the access of individuals to economic institutions decreases.
  E: The rate of deliberate crimes will tend to vary inversely with the level of law enforcement.
","  The answer is (B) The rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to increase if efforts to rehabilitate them are ended.

The passage suggests that the author would agree with the following statement:

(C) The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

The passage states that ""Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.""

This suggests that if the expected utility of lawful activities increases, the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease. However, the passage does not support the idea that ending rehabilitation efforts would lead to a decrease in the rate of deliberate crimes. Instead, it suggests that rehabilitation efforts may be an effective way to reduce the rate of deliberate crimes by increasing the expected utility of lawful activities. Therefore, the author would likely agree with (C) The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.",,,C,0,1052,287,1339,

The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" in line 5 of the passage refers to the process of creating written documents that are based on oral traditions and artifacts from multiple cultures. The correct answer is (E) written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture.

The passage explains that most scholars have focused on written documents that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators, which has led to an overlook of traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. The author argues that these written documents are shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them, and that autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture.",,E,E,1,1097,215,1312,

  D: A name given to one member of a community cannot be given to another member of the same community.
  E: A decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe.
","  Action: Answer(""C"")

The author suggests that in pre-contact Native American cultures, identity was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. The expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events, with the participation of fellow tribal members, and included songs, chants, stories, and dance. The author also notes that a tribe would contribute to the individual's narrative actively by joining in the expression of that narrative.

Option C best aligns with these ideas as it states that a similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities, which is consistent with the author's description of the cultural constructs of highly diverse Native American peoples. In pre-contact Native American cultures, the process of assuming a new name was not unique to an individual but was a common practice among many communities, suggesting a shared understanding of identity that was relational and communal.",,C,B,0,1082,206,1288,
