Additionally, the passage mentions that some legal scholars have criticized Marshall's tactics as a pragmatic attempt to give judges nonlegal material with which to fill gaps in their justifications for decisions where the purely legal principles appear inconclusive.

","  Reflection:

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option D: made individuals who exhibited the behaviors more adept at finding food. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option B: prompted individuals to behave unselfishly.

The passage explains that altruistic mechanisms likely arose in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. These mechanisms would have increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.

Option A is incorrect because it suggests that the behaviors developed through evolutionary processes because they helped spread the genes responsible for those same behaviors. While it is true that the behaviors may have contributed to the spread of those genes, the primary reason for their evolution is the unselfish motivations described in the passage.

Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that the behaviors improved the physical health of individuals who exhibited them. While physical health may have been a byproduct of these behaviors, the primary reason for their evolution is the psychological experiences of identification and empathy.

","  Reflection:
After re-reading the passages and analyzing the arguments presented, I realized that the correct answer is (E) Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable.

Both passages highlight the lack of objective standards in fingerprint identification, which makes it difficult to evaluate the reliability of the evidence. In Passage A, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him, citing the inability of the fingerprint examiner to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The passage acknowledges that while fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. However, it is important to note that the reliability of fingerprint identification is not based on any scientific evidence, but rather on the experience and expertise of the fingerprint examiner.

In Passage B, the author highlights the lack of objective standards for evaluating whether two prints ""match."" The author notes that while some examiners use a ""point-counting"" method, there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. The author also notes that the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown, and that fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smudged. This highlights the uncertainty surrounding the reliability of fingerprint identification, and the need for objective standards to ensure its accuracy.

Therefore, the principle that underlies the arguments in both passages is the importance of objective standards in ensuring the reliability of fingerprint identification. Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards to ensure that their identifications are accurate and reliable.

The author emphasizes that lawyers have a duty to the court and society, and that they should not present false or insincere arguments to the court, even if it means that the defendant may be found guilty. The author also acknowledges that lawyers have a duty to the defendant, but that this duty is not absolute, and that lawyers should not take on cases where they are certain that the defendant is guilty.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) certain that it prevents defense lawyers from representing clients whom they know to be guilty.

I previously answered question D, which states ""In his work with the NAACP during the 1940s and 1950s, Marshall adopted a set of tactics that were previously considered a radical departure from accepted practice, but which he adapted in such a way that they eventually became accepted conventions in the field of law."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is B: ""The litigation strategies that Marshall devised in pursuit of the NAACP's civil rights goals during the 1940s and 1950s constituted significant innovations that have since been adopted as standard tactics for public interest lawyers.""

The passage highlights Marshall's development of strategic and methodological innovations in public interest law, which have been widely adopted by subsequent generations of lawyers. The author notes that Marshall's work with the NAACP, while initially considered radical, became accepted conventions in the field of law. This is consistent with option B, which states that Marshall's litigation strategies have become standard tactics for public interest lawyers.

In contrast, option A is incorrect because while Marshall did develop strategies for litigation, the passage does not suggest that these strategies were controversial or that they proved to be highly successful in arguing against discriminatory laws. Option C is also incorrect because while Marshall's work has had a lasting impact, the passage does not suggest that his contributions to the work of the NAACP have had more of a lasting impact than his achievements as a U.S. Supreme Court justice.

The passage provides historical and cultural context about the corrido, a type of narrative folk song, and its origins in the Lower Rio Grande Border region. The language used is formal and informative, with a focus on the significance of the corrido in affirming the cohesiveness of Border communities. The passage also highlights the conventions of the corrido, such as its use of familiar images and metaphors, and its formal closing verse, or despedida.

In contrast, options A, B, and E are not supported by the passage. Option A is unlikely because the passage does not provide information that would be useful for contemporary tourists visiting the region. Option B is also unlikely because the passage does not focus on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain.

Explanation:

The passage states that Dostoyevsky believed that reality is necessarily shaped by the person who experiences it, and that what may not be reality for one person may be reality for another. This suggests that reality is not an objective, independent entity, but rather a subjective experience that is shaped by individual perspectives and experiences. Therefore, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism, which posited that reality is an objective, independent entity that can be portrayed in literature without reference to individual experiences or perspectives.

Self-reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice (C) art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not align with the passage's description of Dostoyevsky's views on realism. The passage makes it clear that Dostoyevsky believed that reality is not independent of individual experiences, and that literature should reflect this subjective reality.

E: The only reasonable solution to the problem of overdue water bills in the city is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes.

Explanation:
The passage suggests that the city is facing a problem of overdue water bills, with 231,000 customers late paying their bills, owing the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. The city officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. However, the passage also notes that there is a loophole in the law that prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, which makes it difficult to collect the debts.

The only reasonable solution to this problem is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes. This would allow the city to attach liens to the property of delinquent water customers, just like other property-related creditors or tax authorities do. This would automatically make the money owed available whenever a property is sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations.

Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option C: accumulation of financial assets in investments. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option E: generally acknowledged social status in a community.

The passage highlights the democratizing effect of technological advancements, which refers to the process of making new technology accessible to a wider range of people. This is evident in the examples provided, such as the widespread availability of printed materials, personal computers, and electronic mail. These technologies have made it possible for people to access information and communicate with others in ways that were previously reserved for a select few.

Option E, generally acknowledged social status in a community, is the best fit for this concept. The passage does not suggest that the democratizing effect of technology is related to the distribution of tangible and intangible goods (option A), the opportunity to create new technology (option B), or the participation in the regulation of society through either public or private institutions (option D).

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (B).

The author argues that Mortison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, much like how jazz musicians improvise within the fixed scope of a composition. This is a unique and innovative approach to narrative structure, and the passage suggests that Mortison has achieved something significant in this regard. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).

I previously answered question E, which states ""a painting that depicts products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values.""

The passage highlights Lichtenstein's use of comic-art conventions and his faith in reconciliation between cartoons and fine art, as well as his intention to depict contemporary life in a realistic manner. Answer E does not take into account these aspects of Lichtenstein's work.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) a painting that parodies human figures by depicting them as stick figures. This option aligns with the passage's description of Lichtenstein's use of comic-art conventions and his intention to poke fun at the pretensions of the art world while conveying a seriousness of theme. The passage states that Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and that his work displayed an impulse toward realism. Parodying human figures through the use of stick figures is a way to subvert the traditional methods of fine art and create a humorous commentary on the human figure.

Upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) The demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model.

The passage suggests that literary agents will play a crucial role in the transition to the new digital model. The author notes that literary agents marketing new manuscripts will demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors, which will put pressure on traditional publishers to accommodate higher royalty payments. This implies that the demands of literary agents will be a driving force in the transition to the new digital model.

In contrast, options (A) and (B) are not supported by the passage. Option (A) is unlikely, as the passage does not suggest that changing literary tastes will be the main cause of the transition. Option (B) is also unlikely, as the passage does not highlight the ease of keeping books ""in print"" as a primary factor in the transition.

Option (D) is also not supported by the passage, as the author does not discuss the development of innovative marketing strategies as a factor in the transition.

After re-reading the two passages, I realized that Passage B is more tentative in its claims than Passage A. While Passage A presents a more confident and conclusive argument in favor of the reliability of fingerprint identification, Passage B acknowledges the limitations and uncertainties of the field.

Passage B highlights the lack of objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches and the unknown probability of two individuals sharing certain ridge characteristics. It also notes that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and that some proficiency tests have shown examiners making errors. These points suggest that the field of fingerprint identification is not as settled or reliable as Passage A implies.

I previously answered question E, ""Near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies,"" as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that near equality of financial assets is a realistic goal for market economies. In fact, the author argues that the market system tends to diffuse access to new technology across society, making it more accessible to a larger share of the population. This implies that the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people may be narrowed in the long term, but it does not suggest that near equality of financial assets is a realistic goal.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) ""The democratizing influence of technology generally contributes to technological obsolescence."" This answer is supported by the passage's discussion of how new technologies are made accessible to a larger share of the population, leading to a narrowing of the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people.

After reviewing the passage and the question, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect. The passage explains that the utility maximization principle suggests that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice, and that the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. This means that the individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.

To answer the question, I will consider the given options and determine which one is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Option A: The waiter concealing a large part of his tip income from the government is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. While it may seem like a way to reduce taxes, it is illegal and carries a significant risk of detection and penalties. The expected utility of this action is likely to be negative, as the potential costs outweigh any potential benefits.

Option B: The motorist avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. By avoiding a speeding ticket, the motorist can avoid the financial costs associated with the ticket, which outweighs the potential benefits of speeding.

Option C: The industrialist continuing to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. While the cost of treatment may be significant, the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant is likely to be even higher. The expected utility of this action is likely to be negative, as the potential costs outweigh any potential benefits.

Option D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. While the official may believe that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, soliciting bribes is illegal and carries significant legal and financial consequences. The expected utility of this action is likely to be negative, as the potential costs outweigh any potential benefits.

Option E: The worker physically assaulting his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. While the worker may be angry and frustrated, resorting to violence is not a rational or legal response. The expected utility of this action is likely to be negative, as the potential costs outweigh any potential benefits.

""I believe the best answer is (B) respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence. The passage highlights Lichtenstein's use of comic-art conventions and his ability to reconcile different art forms, suggesting that the artist's work is successful in its parody of popular culture. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not fully capture the author's attitude towards Lichtenstein's work.

Now, based on the passage provided, the best answer is indeed (E) appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete. The author's attitude towards Lichtenstein's work is one of admiration for the artist's ability to reconcile different art forms and to create work that is both realistic and naive. The passage highlights the artist's use of comic-art conventions and his ability to depict contemporary life in a way that is both reflective and innocent, which suggests a positive attitude towards Lichtenstein's work.

Initial Answer: D) necessary

Reasoning: The passage suggests that the test case strategy developed by Marshall was a deliberate and intentional approach to litigation, designed to achieve specific goals and address systemic injustices. The author notes that Marshall ""carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed"" (para. 5), and that he used sociological and psychological statistics to persuade courts of the constitutional violations of discriminatory laws (para. 6). This suggests that Marshall's approach was not arbitrary or inflexible, but rather a deliberate and strategic effort to advance the NAACP's goals.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) unprecedented. The passage highlights the innovative nature of Marshall's approach, noting that the NAACP's campaign against state-sanctioned racial segregation involved ""a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated"" (para. 4). This approach was new and groundbreaking at the time, and it has since become the norm for U.S. public interest litigation.

The passage highlights the importance of familiar language and thematic conventions in corridos, which are specific to the Border region. The use of metaphors and ready-made lines in corridos are also consistent with the ballad tradition, but the passage suggests that these features are unique to the corrido form.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered question D, ""No particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

The passage suggests that the secondary substances in plants have evolved as a result of genetic mutations, and that natural selection has favored those substances that are beneficial to the plant, such as those that attract pollinators or serve as defenses against insects. The passage also states that insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' chemical defenses, which suggests that the secondary substances in plants have evolved in response to the interactions between plants and insects.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The diversity of secondary substances that develop in a plant population is proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history.

Initial answer: I chose option A, ""draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not accurately reflect Dostoyevsky's views. The passage makes it clear that Dostoyevsky believed there was no clear distinction between reality and fantasy, and that reality was far more complex than the merely tangible. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer.

New answer: I believe the correct answer is option B, ""put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work."" The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that the purpose of a literary work was more important than its formal qualities. He believed that a work's artistic merit was essential, but that it was not the only factor to consider. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Explanation:
The passage states that Dostoyevsky believed that the task of the writer was to ""explode the boundaries of the so-called real world."" This suggests that he saw the world as a complex and multifaceted place, and that he believed that literature should reflect this complexity. Dostoyevsky also believed that the purpose of a literary work was more important than its formal qualities, as he stated that ""artistry is quite simply the ability to write well.""

The passage highlights how Lichtenstein's use of comic book elements in his paintings is not solely a parodic reaction to the high-mindedness of later abstract expressionism but also demonstrates an attempt to achieve realistic and nostalgic effects simultaneously. The passage emphasizes that Lichtenstein's work is not just a simple parody but rather a deliberate attempt to reconcile different art forms and create something new and meaningful.

The passage also highlights the complexity of Lichtenstein's work, which is not just a simple rebellion against the excessive sophistication of the art world but also an attempt to re-create the emotionally powerful work of earlier abstract expressionists. The passage notes that Lichtenstein's use of comic book elements demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art but also between parody and true feeling.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered that abstract expressionism moved from intensity to lyricism over time, but upon further reflection, I realize that this is incorrect. The passage actually suggests that abstract expressionism lost much of its force by the time pop art emerged in the early 1960s. This means that abstract expressionism was not moving towards lyricism, but rather losing its emotional power.

Based on the passage, the most reasonable inference about abstract expressionism is:

C: Over time, it moved from intellectualism to emotionalism.

The passage states that by the time pop art emerged, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force, suggesting that it had become overly intellectualized and lacked emotional power. This is in contrast to pop art, which was characterized by a return to the depiction of contemporary life and a focus on realism.

The passage describes the organization of the theory of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which is the main topic of the passage. The author presents evidence in support of this theory by explaining the structure of receptors and how they mediate the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The author also presents an alternative theory, which is the idea that the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane.

The passage does not present evidence against the theory, nor does it argue in favor of rejecting it. Instead, it provides a detailed explanation of the theory and its implications, as well as an alternative explanation for how neurotransmitters might transmit signals.

Reasoning:

The passage explains that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions. Attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and open its channel component, allowing ions to flow through. This process is the key mechanism by which chemical signals are converted into electrical activity in neurons. Therefore, choice D is the best answer.

The passage highlights the significance of music in the African American tradition and how it has influenced literature. The author emphasizes the importance of music as a cultural artifact and a source of inspiration for writers. This excerpt conveys the author's admiration and appreciation for the role of music in shaping the literary landscape.

In contrast, choice B focuses on the structural elements of the novel, specifically the way in which the story is told. While the author acknowledges the connection between music and the novel's structure, the primary emphasis is on the narrative technique rather than the cultural significance of music.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, which highlights the author's attitude toward music as a cultural artifact and a source of inspiration for literature.",,,A,0,1223,281,1504,

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option D: A better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the author of passage A would be most likely to agree with option B: At least the plan would have a lower social cost than would turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time.

The author of passage A is concerned with the overinclusive nature of laws and the costs associated with enforcing them to the letter. They argue that allowing discretionary nonenforcement can reduce these costs without increasing underinclusion (loopholes). In the context of the plan described in passage B, the author would likely agree that targeting a few high-income neighborhoods and selectively cutting off water to a few residences is a less socially costly approach than shutting off water to all 231,000 households that have not paid on time.

Option A is not a viable answer, as the author does not suggest delaying the implementation of the plan until after the legislature's annual appropriations hearing.

Option C is also not a good fit, as the author does not argue that the plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.

Option E is not a relevant answer, as the passage does not discuss specific laws regarding the payment of water bills.

I previously answered choice (B) as the correct objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not the strongest objection.

The correct answer is choice (E): Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. This objection is the strongest because it highlights the importance of adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied in order to truly understand it. The other choices do not address this point as directly.

For example, choice (A) is incorrect because it suggests that one cannot adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless they are a member of that culture. While this may be true to some extent, it is not a sufficient condition for understanding a culture.

Choice (B) is also incorrect because it suggests that many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another. While it is true that some non-Western societies share similar values, this does not mean that they can be understood solely through the lens of Western values.

Choice (C) is also incorrect because it suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. While this may be the case in some instances, it is not a universal practice and does not address the broader issue of understanding cultures through their own perspectives and methods.

Finally, choice (D) is incorrect because it suggests that students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations. While it is true that Western scientific methods have their own value and limitations, this does not mean that they are the only way to understand cultural achievements.

In conclusion, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

The passage suggests that the digital publishing model will eliminate the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This means that the need for warehousing will not shift to paper and binding material, as there will be no physical books to store.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers.

","  Reflection:

After re-reading the passage, I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. The passage suggests that the author would likely agree with statement C, ""The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.""

The passage explains that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice based on the principle of utility maximization. According to this principle, an individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility. Therefore, if the expected utility of lawful activities increases, the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease.

On the other hand, statements A, B, and D are not supported by the passage.

Statement A suggests that stronger punishments for repeat offenders will lead to a decrease in the rate of criminal activity. However, the passage does not provide any evidence to support this claim. In fact, it suggests that increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement may actually increase the likelihood of detection and punishment, which could lead to an increase in the rate of criminal activity.

Statement B suggests that ending rehabilitation efforts will lead to an increase in the rate of criminal activity. However, the passage does not provide any evidence to support this claim. In fact, it suggests that rehabilitation efforts can be an effective way to reduce the rate of criminal activity by addressing the underlying causes of criminal behavior.

Statement D suggests that a decrease in the access of individuals to economic institutions will lead to an increase in the rate of deliberate crimes. However, the passage does not provide any evidence to support this claim. In fact, it suggests that increasing the access of individuals to economic institutions can be an effective way to reduce the rate of deliberate crimes by providing individuals with alternative means of obtaining the resources they need.

I previously answered choice (D) as the most consistent with the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not correct.

This means that the expression of personal history was not solely dependent on individual experiences but was also shaped by cultural perspectives and social codes.

Therefore, the most consistent answer is choice (C) - a similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities.
