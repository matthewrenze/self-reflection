The phrase ""defined categories of neurons"" is used in the context of designing drugs targeted to specific receptors on these neurons to selectively impede or enhance certain effects. This implies that these neurons have specific characteristics that differentiate them from other neurons.
The passage mentions that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions. This suggests that neurons with these receptors have channels for ions. However, this is not the defining characteristic that the author is referring to, as not all neurons with ion channels are necessarily part of the ""defined categories"" mentioned.
The passage also mentions that each of the receptors in the neurotransmitter-gated ion channel family comes in several varieties, with slightly different properties in different parts of the brain. This suggests that the defining characteristic of the ""defined categories"" of neurons is their specific receptor variety and location in the brain, which influences particular brain functions.

The author's attitude towards the twofold obligation is that it is necessary for defense lawyers to balance their responsibilities to both the defendant and the court/society. The author believes that lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, but should also present the case in the client's favor and argue for leniency if they know the client is guilty. The author also believes that lawyers should carefully analyze the facts of the case and only take cases where they are convinced of the merits.

","Thought:
The passage discusses the novel ""Jazz"" by Toni Morrison and its connection to music, specifically jazz. The author of the passage highlights how Morrison uses a narrative structure that is analogous to the playing of a jazz band, intertwining ensemble sound with individual solo performances. The passage also mentions how this structure is similar to the compositional style of Duke Ellington.

The question asks what can be inferred from the passage about the author's view of Morrison's use of narrative techniques inspired by jazz.

Choice D is the best answer because it correctly identifies that the structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional style involves more than just shifting between first-person and third-person narrators. The passage discusses how Morrison's narrative structure is analogous to the playing of a jazz band, which involves more than just shifting between different points of view.

The concept of increasing returns to scale refers to the idea that as the size of a business or operation increases, its efficiency and productivity also increase, allowing it to produce more per unit of input.

Choice B best illustrates this concept. A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar. This increased productivity allows the colony to feed a larger population, which can then better divide up the work of processing the nectar. This creates a cycle of increasing returns to scale.

The passage discusses the relationship between plants and insects, specifically how secondary substances in plants have evolved in response to insects. These substances can either attract pollinating insects or serve as a defense mechanism against plant-eating insects. Insects, in turn, have evolved ways to circumvent these defenses.

The author would most likely agree with choice D, as it accurately reflects the information presented in the passage. The passage states that secondary substances first appeared as a result of genetic mutations, but were conserved by natural selection because they either attracted pollinating insects or defended against plant-eating insects. This implies that insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species, but not that any particular substance appeared in direct response to insects.

The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on the purpose of literature and its relationship to reality and usefulness. The radical critics believed that literature should be useful by depicting reality as it is and contributing to the creation of a new society. However, Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. He also believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit and that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. He defined artistic as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts. Therefore, the description of a work of literature as ""useful"" mainly refers to its effectiveness at communicating the author's ideas.

The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first because it still uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden and may distort the understanding of non-Western cultures. The objection argues that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.

Choice A is not a strong objection because it is not necessarily true that one must be a member of a culture to adopt its perspectives and methods.

Choice B is not relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Choice C is a strong objection because it suggests that some non-Western societies already use their own value systems when studying other cultures, which contradicts the criticism that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first.

Choice D is not relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Choice E is not a strong objection because it does not address the specific criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

The scenario described in the first two paragraphs suggests that most books will be digitized and printed on demand at the point of sale, eliminating the need for physical inventory and the associated costs of warehousing, shipping, and displaying physical books. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing.

Choice A suggests that the need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books. However, the scenario described in the first two paragraphs suggests that books will be printed on demand at the point of sale, eliminating the need for warehousing of individual books. Therefore, it is unlikely that the need for warehousing will shift mainly to paper and binding material.

Choice B suggests that the patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly. However, the scenario described in the first two paragraphs suggests that most books will be digitized and printed on demand at the point of sale, making it easier for customers to purchase new books. Therefore, it is unlikely that the patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly.

Choice C suggests that most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers. However, the scenario described in the first two paragraphs suggests that books will be printed on demand at the point of sale, eliminating the need for physical inventory and the associated costs of warehousing, shipping, and displaying physical books. Therefore, it is unlikely that most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers.

Choice D suggests that there will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers. However, the scenario described in the first two paragraphs does not suggest that the demand for copy editors and book designers will decrease significantly. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers.

Choice E suggests that the demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly.

Passage A discusses the reliability of fingerprint identification in the context of a criminal trial and the defendant's challenge to the fingerprint evidence used against him. The passage mentions the lack of established error rates and uniform, objective standards, but ultimately concludes that fingerprint identification is reliable based on its long history of use and the consistent ""points and characteristics"" approach used by examiners.

Passage B discusses the lack of objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches and the unknown error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice. The passage highlights the differences in identification practices used by various fingerprint examiners and the potential for errors in declaring a match.
