Passage A discusses how evolutionary psychology can explain human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior. The passage then focuses on the problem of altruism and how it may have arisen in early humans due to psychological experiences of identification and empathy, which could have initially arisen in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The passage suggests that these psychological states could have increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.

The author argues that defense lawyers have a twofold obligation: to the defendant and to the court/society. The author believes that lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false, and that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. The author also believes that lawyers should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. The author believes that the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society ultimately benefits the defendant.

Explanation: 
The passage discusses how Thurgood Marshall's work with the NAACP in the 1940s and 1950s resulted in significant innovations in public interest litigation strategies that have since become standard tactics for lawyers pursuing various public purposes. The passage describes how Marshall and the NAACP developed a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated, including the test case strategy, which involved sponsoring litigation of tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision. The passage also notes that Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants and used sociological and psychological statistics as a means of transforming constitutional law. The passage concludes by noting that Marshall's techniques have been widely adopted by public interest law firms in the U.S. for various public purposes.

Corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. They combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. Corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. They tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments, and use highly conventional and readily recognizable imagery and ready-made lines.

","Thought:
The passage discusses how Toni Morrison used jazz as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz. The narration of the novel is similar to the playing of a jazz hand, where individual musicians' improvisations are performed within the composer's frame. The narrator of Jazz is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. The central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.

The lobster industry is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.

","Thought:
The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, which conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. His work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness.

The question asks for a pair of tactics used by an environmental-advocacy public interest law firm that is most closely analogous to the strategies used by Marshall during his work with the NAACP.

Marshall also carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants and used sociological and psychological statistics as a means of transforming constitutional law.

Explanation: The fourth paragraph explains the difficulty associated with modeling the Pin Factory, which is a particular economic assumption that describes increasing returns to scale. The paragraph explains that economists have always sought to represent their ideas using numbers and equations, but the Pin Factory is notoriously hard to represent mathematically. The paragraph goes on to explain that many economists tried to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought, but they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Therefore, the main purpose of the fourth paragraph is to explain a difficulty associated with modeling a particular economic assumption.",,B,B,1,865,123,988,

The scenario described in the first two paragraphs suggests that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories.

Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used for 100 years and has long been considered reliable, despite the lack of uniform, objective standards. The court sees no reason to reject it outright.
Passage B argues that there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.

  B: The rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to increase if efforts to rehabilitate them are ended.
  C: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

The passage discusses the economic principle of utility maximization and how it can be used to analyze the rational decision-making process of individuals who commit crimes. The passage also discusses how both increasing penalties for crimes and strengthening law enforcement, as well as increasing economic opportunities for individuals, can affect the expected utility of criminal activity and lawful activity. The passage does not discuss the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity.
