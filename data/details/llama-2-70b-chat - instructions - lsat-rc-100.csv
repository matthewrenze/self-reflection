Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A. However, upon reflection, I realize that option C is the best answer. The passage suggests that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. This is because the methods of Western science are value-laden and may not be suitable for understanding cultures that have different values and perspectives. Therefore, option C is the most likely answer.

Additionally, option A is not the best answer because the study of moral codes across different cultures does not necessarily involve the use of Western scientific methods. Option B is also not the best answer because the study of a culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires does not necessarily involve the use of Western scientific methods. Option D is not the best answer because the study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values is not necessarily objectionable from the perspective of multicultural education. Option E is not the best answer because the study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture is not necessarily objectionable from the perspective of multicultural education.

In passage A, the author explains altruistic behavior by suggesting that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother's instinct to help her injured child. This explanation implies that the mother's behavior is not solely motivated by her own interests or desires, but rather by an underlying genetic interest that she may not even be aware of.

","  Sure, here's my revised answer:

Action: Answer(""D"")

Reflection:
I initially answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A. However, upon reflection, I realized that option D is the best answer.

The passage explains that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries because it was easier to represent mathematically. The author argues that increasing returns, which are characteristic of the Pin Factory, are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Therefore, option D, which states that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

If the size required to achieve increasing returns varies widely from industry to industry, then it's not necessarily the case that bigger businesses will dominate smaller ones in every industry. This means that there may be industries where smaller businesses can still compete effectively, even if they don't have the same economies of scale as larger businesses. Therefore, option D weakens the argument that increased size necessarily leads to monopoly power.

In contrast, option A, which states that there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions, doesn't necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It's possible that these businesses are still able to exert monopoly power because they have a dominant market share in their region, even if there are larger businesses in other regions.

Option B, which states that workers who specialize in narrower tasks are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks, doesn't seem relevant to the question. The passage doesn't discuss the impact of specialization on worker salaries.

Option C, which states that when an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would, is actually a separate issue from the connection between increased size and monopoly power. While collusion can certainly be a problem in industries with few players, it's not necessarily a direct result of increased size.

Finally, option E, which states that any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover, doesn't seem relevant to the question either. The passage doesn't discuss the potential drawbacks of specialization.",,D,E,0,1174,564,1738,

","  My apologies for the confusion. I'll be happy to help you with this question.

The correct answer is E: An evolutionary explanation of altruistic behavior may lie in the psychological states brought about in early humans by cues of kinship or familiarity.

Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology can be used to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution. It discusses how altruistic behavior, which appears to be selfless, can be explained by the psychological experiences of identification and empathy that are triggered by cues of kinship or familiarity. These experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The passage suggests that the psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.

Therefore, option E is the best answer, as it accurately states the main point of passage A.

In contrast, option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that altruistic behavior tends to diminish the reproductive success of individuals that exhibit it. Option B is also incorrect because while new evidence may explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, the passage does not mention any specific evidence.

The correct answer is choice A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.

This choice calls the author's assertion into question by suggesting that the similarity between Jazz and jazz music is not just a matter of style, but rather a deliberate attempt by Morrison to simulate the style of jazz performance in her narration.

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my refection on the problem and the correct answer:

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests that which one of the following is true of secondary substances in plants?
Choices:
  A: Some of them are the results of recent natural mutations in plants.
  B: They typically contribute to a plant's taste or smell, but not both.
  C: Some of them undergo chemical reactions with substances produced by insects, thus altering the plants' chemical composition.
  D: Some species of plants produce only one such substance.
  E: A few of them act as regulators of plants'
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A. However, upon reflection, I realize that the passage does not suggest that recent natural mutations in plants are responsible for the development of secondary substances. Instead, the passage states that secondary substances ""undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants."" This suggests that the development of secondary substances is an ongoing process that has been occurring over millions of years, rather than a recent event.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: A few of them act as regulators of plants' growth or metabolism. The passage states that secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. However, it also suggests that some secondary substances act as defensive substances that help protect plants from insects. These defensive substances may regulate the growth or metabolism of the plant in some way, such as by deterring insects from feeding on the plant.

In conclusion, my previous answer was incorrect, and the correct answer is E: A few of them act as regulators of plants' growth or metabolism.",,,A,0,1098,1047,2145,

In passage A, the use of ""discretionary"" implies that law enforcement agencies have the power to choose which cases to pursue, while in passage B, ""selectively"" suggests that officials have the ability to choose which residences to target in their effort to collect overdue water bills.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: misinterpreting the interests that motivate human actions.

Evolutionary psychologists propose that human behavior can be explained by the interest in propagating genes, but this explanation is questionable because it is not the only possible explanation for human behavior. According to Passage B, there are often many interests that could explain a particular behavior, and it is not always possible to determine which interest is the decisive factor. Therefore, the explanation provided by evolutionary psychologists for certain human behaviors, such as misinterpreting the interests that motivate human actions, may not be reliable.

","  Sure, here's my revised answer:

Topic: Law
Context: Most of what has been written about Thurgood Marshall, a former United States Supreme Court justice who served from 1967 to 1991, has just focused on his judicial record and on the ideological content of his earlier achievements as a lawyer pursuing civil rights issues in the courts. But when Marshall's career is viewed from a technical perspective, his work with the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) reveals a strategic and methodological legacy to the field of public interest law. Though the NAACP, under Marshall's direction, was not the first legal organization in the U.S. to be driven by a political and social agenda, he and the NAACP developed innovations that forever changed the landscape of public interest law: during the 1940s and 1950s, in their campaign against state-sanctioned racial segregation, Marshall and the NAACP, instead of simply pursuing cases as the opportunity arose, set up a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated. One aspect of this campaign, the test case strategy, involved sponsoring litigation of tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision. This allowed Marshall to try out different approaches and discover which was the best to be used. An essential element in the success of this tactic was the explicit recognition that in a public interest legal campaign, choosing the right plaintiff can mean the difference between success and failure. Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed. In addition, Marshall used sociological and psychological statistics—presented in expert testimony, for example, about the psychological impact of enforced segregation—as a means of transforming constitutional law by persuading the courts that certain discriminatory laws produced public harms in violation of constitutional principles. This tactic, while often effective, has been criticized by some legal scholars as a pragmatic attempt to give judges nonlegal material with which to fill gaps in their justifications for decisions where the purely legal principles appear inconclusive. Since the time of Marshall's work with the NAACP, the number of public interest law firms in the U.S. has grown substantially, and they have widely adopted his combination of strategies for litigation, devoting them to various public purposes. These strategies have been used, for example, in consumer advocacy campaigns and, more recently, by politically conservative public interest lawyers seeking to achieve, through litigation, changes in the law that they have not been able to accomplish in the legislature. If we focus on the particular content of Marshall's goals and successes, it might seem surprising that his work has influenced the quest for such divergent political objectives, but the techniques that he honed— originally considered to be a radical departure from accepted conventions—have become the norm for U.S. public interest litigation today.

","  Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, ""El Corrido de Kiansis"" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular ""El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,"" for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: ""I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me."" Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including ""Kiansis,"" which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of ""Gregorio Cortez"" is translated as follows: ""Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez."" The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my refection on the question:

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as ""literature"" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing has aspired to the condition of music, in which form contributes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as if with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he conducted.
  E: Though he composed and conducted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A. However, upon reflection, I realize that the passage does not explicitly state that Morrison credited Ellington with inspiring her style of narration. Instead, the passage highlights the similarity between Ellington's compositional style and Morrison's literary style in Jazz. Therefore, the best answer is option D, ""He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he conducted."" This answer choice is supported by the passage's statement that Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind.

However, the author notes that unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects. The author then goes on to describe research that has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption, which suggests that wine may have ameliorating effects on factors that contribute to premature heart disease.

The authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.

Passage A states that ""fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate"" and that ""examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements."" However, Passage B argues that there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. Passage B also mentions a more rigorous test that showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.

Therefore, the authors would likely disagree on the likelihood of erroneous identification, with Passage A suggesting a low error rate and Passage B suggesting a higher error rate due to the lack of consensus and rigorous testing.

The objection in the second paragraph argues that the Western scientific heritage is founded on an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. It also argues that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective. This option aligns with the objection's argument that adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary for real understanding.

My previous answer, option A, does not align with the objection's argument. Option A states that the social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A.

The ease of keeping books ""in print"" and the elimination of whole categories of expenses are highlighted as key advantages of digital publishing. Therefore, option B is the best choice.

Additionally, the author notes that literary agents will demand a larger share of revenue for their authors under the digital publishing model, but this is not seen as the primary driver of the transition to digital publishing. The author also does not mention innovative marketing strategies or widespread familiarity with new ways of storing information as key factors in the acceptance of the new digital model.

Here's my reflection on the problem:

The passage states that the Pin Factory model has long been ignored in economic thought because it is difficult to represent mathematically. This suggests that the field of economics has historically prioritized mathematical rigor over other considerations, such as accurately modeling real-world phenomena.

The correct answer is B: Economics fails in its quest to be scientific because its models lack mathematical rigor.

Here's my explanation for why the other choices are incorrect:

A: The passage does not suggest that increases in worker specialization are the only way to achieve increasing returns to scale. In fact, it mentions that larger firms can achieve lower costs through specialization, but it does not imply that this is the only way to achieve increasing returns.

C: The passage states that the Pin Factory model's long-standing failure to gain prominence among economists was not a problem of ideology, but rather a problem of mathematical rigor. Therefore, choice C is incorrect.

D: Under the Pin Factory model, firms can achieve increasing returns to scale, which can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly. Therefore, choice D is incorrect.

E: The passage does not suggest that Adam Smith did not recognize any tension between the Pin Factory model and the Invisible Hand model. In fact, the passage states that Smith recognized the tension between the two models and struggled to reconcile them. Therefore, choice E is incorrect.

Passage A assertively states that fingerprint identification has been reliable and widely accepted for 100 years, and that there is no reason to reject it. In contrast, Passage B acknowledges that there are no objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches and that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study. Passage B also mentions that different examiners use different methods and that there is no consensus on the number of points of similarity needed for a match. Therefore, Passage B presents a more cautious and nuanced view of fingerprint identification, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of the technique.

* The author states that economists had tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought but failed.

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
After reflecting on my previous answer, I realized that I misunderstood the question. The correct answer is indeed B: The frequent use of proverbs within any community functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community.

The passage suggests that proverbs serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity among Mexican American young people, and that they provide a means of enhancing their familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition. This implies that the frequent use of proverbs within Mexican American communities is, at least in part, intended to convey a sense of ethnicity to children within that community.

Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question. I mistakenly thought that the correct answer was A: If a proverb is used to inculcate table manners, then its primary purpose is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition.

However, upon reflection, I realized that this option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not suggest that the primary purpose of proverbs is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition, but rather that they serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity among young people.

I also considered option E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.

However, this option is also not supported by the passage, which does not mention anything about the emphasis on teaching children about peer-group relationships being unique to Mexican American communities.

Previously, I answered this question incorrectly by choosing option A: express curiosity about an artist's work. However, upon closer examination of the passage, it's clear that the author's primary purpose is not to express curiosity but to clarify the motivation behind Roy Lichtenstein's work.

The passage discusses Lichtenstein's work in the context of pop art and explores how it differed from other pop artists. It highlights Lichtenstein's use of comic-art conventions and how it demonstrates a faith in reconciliation between cartoons and fine art, as well as between parody and true feeling. The author also contrasts Lichtenstein's work with that of other pop artists, noting that his work exuded a kind of deliberate naivete in response to the excess of sophistication he observed in other artists.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option B: clarify the motivation behind an artist's work. The passage aims to provide insight into Lichtenstein's artistic choices and motivations, rather than simply expressing curiosity about his work.

  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (E) A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.

In this context, option (E) is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. Physically assaulting a former supervisor in a crowded workplace is not a rational response to the economic incentives and disincentives present in the situation. The expected utility from such an action would likely be negative, as it could result in legal consequences, damage to one's reputation, and harm to one's future job prospects. Additionally, it is not a response that is driven by a desire to maximize utility, but rather by a desire to exact revenge or express anger.

On the other hand, options (A), (B), and (C) can be seen as rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives. Option (A) involves concealing income to reduce taxes, which is a rational response to the economic incentive of minimizing tax liability. Option (B) involves avoiding speeding to avoid a fine and loss of a driver's license, which is a rational response to the economic disincentive of the fine and the potential loss of a valuable asset. Option (C) involves illegally discharging a pollutant because the cost of treatment exceeds the fine, which is a rational response to the economic incentive of minimizing costs.

Option (D) is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The government official in an impoverished country may risk prosecution for soliciting bribes because the salary provided by the government is inadequate to support themselves and their family. In this case, the expected utility from soliciting bribes may exceed the expected utility from not doing so, given the potential financial benefits and the need to support oneself and one's family.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

The reference to railroads serves to call attention to the increasing prevalence of industries that have characteristics of the Pin Factory.

This is in contrast to the traditional assumption of diminishing returns, which states that the larger a business becomes, the less efficient it becomes. The reference to railroads highlights the fact that many industries, like railroads, have characteristics that are more in line with the Pin Factory model, where increasing returns to scale are a major factor. Therefore, choice C is the best answer.

In my previous answer, I chose choice B, thinking that the reference to railroads was used to illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor.

In my previous response, I incorrectly answered this question as ""A: In at least some cases, the dependence of corridos on ready-made lines hindered the efforts of corrido makers to use metaphor effectively.""

Upon reflection, I realized that the passage actually suggests the opposite - that the use of ready-made lines in corridos allows for more effective use of metaphor. The passage states that ""figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners."" This suggests that the use of familiar images and ready-made lines in corridos serves to strengthen the continuity of the corrido tradition and allows for more effective storytelling.

Instead, the passage suggests that insects have played a major role in the development of secondary substances in plants, but does not make a direct correlation between the number of insects and the diversity of secondary substances.

Therefore, the best answer is option D, which states that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species.

Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. This is the correct answer, D.

Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit,"" and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms. Therefore, option D is the best answer, as it suggests that the radical critics should recognize the importance of artistic merit in evaluating literary works, which would align with Dostoyevsky's views.

My previous answer, option A, was incorrect because while Dostoyevsky did believe that reality and fantasy were intertwined, he did not believe that the distinction between the two was necessarily important in evaluating a literary work. Therefore, option A does not accurately reflect Dostoyevsky's views.

","  Answer: E

The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it uses a musical genre as the structuring principle for the entire novel. The literary device used is the unique narrative strategy, which is analogous to Duke Ellington's style of musical composition. The narrative strategy allows individual characters' voices to be heard within the overall structure of the narrative, similar to a jazz ensemble allowing for individual solo performances within the framework of the composer's piece.

The passage highlights how Morrison's use of this narrative strategy is innovative and effective in conveying the main theme of the novel, which is the unique narrative strategy itself. The passage also notes that Morrison's style of narration is a literary analogue of Duke Ellington's style of musical composition, where individual musicians' improvisations are performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame.

Therefore, the correct answer is option E, which states that Morrison has succeeded in creating an original and effective narrative strategy that is a literary analogue of Duke Ellington's style of musical composition.

","  Action: Answer(B)

Reflection:
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as ""literature"" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing has aspired to the condition of music, in which form contributes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as if with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.

","  Passage A:
The main argument in Passage A is that evolutionary psychology can explain human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior. The author argues that altruistic behavior, which appears to be unselfish, can be explained by the theory of evolution. The author suggests that psychological experiences of identification and empathy could have initially arisen in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors.

Passage B:
The main argument in Passage B is that evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory that explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of. The author suggests that interests in the proliferation of genes cannot be the sole explanation for certain behaviors, as there are often various interests that could explain the behavior. The author argues that to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior, the behavior must be reasonable only if one had that interest.

Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as if with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The passage contains information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Do any African American visual artists also attempt to emulate African American music in their work?
  B: In what way is Jazz stylistically similar to other literary works by Morrison?
  C: After the publication of Jazz, did critics quickly acknowledge the innovative nature of the narrative style that Morrison uses in that novel?

  E: What characteristic of Jazz is also present in the work of some other African American writers?

Action: Answer(E)

The passage contains information that most helps to answer the question, ""What characteristic of Jazz is also present in the work of some other African American writers?"" The passage explains that Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is stylistically similar to the art of composition perfected by Duke Ellington, and that it redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view by simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity. The passage also mentions that many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, but none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in Jazz. Therefore, the characteristic of Jazz that is also present in the work of some other African American writers is the use of music as a structuring principle and the attempt to simulate the style of music in literature.",,,E,0,1178,984,2162,

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

The correct answer is C: Moderate consumption of wine made from plums or apples rather than grapes would be unlikely to reduce the risk of premature heart disease.

The passage states that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages. This implies that moderate consumption of wine made from other fruits, such as plums or apples, may not have the same health benefits as moderate consumption of grape wine.

According to Dostoyevsky's definition of an ""artistic"" work, it should possess the ability to express the author's thoughts in characters and images in a way that the reader can fully understand the author's thoughts after finishing the novel.

Option B meets this criteria as it describes a novel where the author's ideas are given substance through suitable characters and events. This means that the work is not just a vehicle for the author's ideas, but also uses those ideas to create a coherent and engaging narrative.

Option A, on the other hand, focuses on illustrating brutal facts, which may not necessarily be artistic. Option C uses allegory, which can be artistic, but the purpose of the work is to communicate a criticism of feudal society, which may not align with Dostoyevsky's definition. Option D is an autobiographical essay, which may not be considered artistic according to Dostoyevsky's definition.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, ""effectiveness at communicating the author's ideas."" Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images in a way that allows the reader to fully understand the author's thoughts. This definition emphasizes the importance of effective communication in literature, rather than its potential to bring about social change.

The passage describes how scientists compiled evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.

The author also notes that it was only when Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations that the concept of nuclear fission was coined.

The author's primary aim in writing the passage is to illustrate the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress.

The correct answer is (B) The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.

The passage states that the researchers were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms, and they had a common view that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse. This suggests that they had preconceived notions about the outcome of the experiments and were not open to alternative interpretations.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (E) Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

The passage argues that the second version of multicultural education, which adopts a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific methods to examine cultures, is problematic. The critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded on an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. Therefore, using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is distorting and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

Option (E) directly addresses this issue by asserting that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. This means that adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture studied is essential for understanding and appreciating its value system. Therefore, option (E) provides the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.

Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests that only members of a culture can adopt its perspectives and methods, which is not necessarily true. Option (B) is also incorrect because it does not address the issue of understanding and appreciating non-Western cultures. Option (C) is irrelevant to the criticism in the passage. Option (D) is incorrect because it focuses on the understanding of one's own culture rather than the understanding of other cultures.

The fourth paragraph explains that the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns - the Pin Factory - are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough.

Therefore, the main purpose of the fourth paragraph is to explain the difficulty associated with modeling the economic assumption of increasing returns, which is represented by the Pin Factory, and how it has been a challenge for economists to represent this concept mathematically.

Passage A discusses the reliability of fingerprint identification in criminal trials and how it has been used for 100 years with consistent results.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my error was due to a misunderstanding of the question and the provided choices.

The passage suggests that the author would be likely to agree with each of the following statements EXCEPT:

The correct answer is (C) The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

The passage states that the expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.

Therefore, if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases, it would make criminal activity more attractive, and the rate of deliberate crimes would likely increase, not decrease.

So, the correct answer is (C) The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A. However, upon reflection, I realize that option B is more consistent with the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures. The author emphasizes that identity was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Option B suggests that a pictograph that represents a specific person incorporates the symbol for a constellation, indicating that the person's identity is connected to the natural world and the cosmos. This is consistent with the idea that pre-contact Native American cultures viewed identity as inclusive and relational.

In contrast, option A states that a person who is born into one tribe but is brought up by members of another tribe retains a name given at birth. While this option suggests that identity is not solely determined by biological ties, it does not necessarily reflect the idea of a relational identity that is connected to the natural world and the cosmos.

Therefore, I have changed my answer to option B, which better reflects the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures.",,B,B,1,1151,269,1420,
