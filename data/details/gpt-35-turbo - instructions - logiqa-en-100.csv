The argument states that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, based on the excavation of tools, pottery, obsidian, silver, and copper utensils.

Choice B contradicts the idea that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, but it does not provide any evidence to support this claim.
Choice C supports the argument, so it cannot be the correct answer.

Option A contradicts the experts' opinion because it states that a nature reserve was established, and local herders' awareness of protecting Xinjiang Northern Salamander is increasing.

","Self-reflection:
The conclusion of the argument is that whether a person does good behavior or bad behavior depends on the length of his life. The evidence used to support this conclusion is that if a person only lived one day, it would be best for him to steal other people's things because he would not suffer the fear of being caught. The assumption made in the argument is that the fear of being caught is the only factor that determines whether a person will engage in bad behavior.

","Self-reflection:
The question stem talks about how regulations can prohibit things that are not inherently wrong and require things that are inherently wrong. It also mentions that we can evaluate prescribed right and wrong. The question asks which option supports the argument. 
Option A talks about how we need regulations to judge right and wrong, which supports the argument. 
Option B talks about punishment from heaven, which is not relevant to the argument. 
Option C talks about how rules and standards are behind the judgment of right and wrong, which supports the argument. 
Option D talks about how moral regulations vary from person to person and place to place, which weakens the argument.

","Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting answer choice C, which talks about the difference between gene screening and cloning. However, this answer choice does not directly refute the views of ordinary people about the possibility of ""customized babies"". After reflecting on the problem, I realized that the key to answering this question is to identify the views of ordinary people and choose the answer that provides evidence against the possibility of those views. 
Action: Answer(""D"") 
Explanation: 
The views of ordinary people are that humans may usher in the era of ""customized babies"". Answer choice D refutes this view by stating that ""customized babies"" have not been tried globally, and this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics. This answer choice provides evidence against the possibility of ""customized babies"" and therefore best refutes the views of ordinary people.",,D,C,0,644,175,819,
