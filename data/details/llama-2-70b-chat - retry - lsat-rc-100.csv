  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","  Answer: C

Explanation:
Proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph argue that real understanding of non-Western cultures can only be achieved by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would be considered objectionable by these proponents.

Choice C, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, is the best answer. This choice is objectionable because it goes against the idea of adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied. Instead, it imposes Western scientific methods onto a culture that may not share the same values or ways of thinking.

The other choices do not necessarily involve the use of Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures. Choice A, a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies, may involve comparing different moral codes, but it does not necessarily involve the use of Western scientific methods. Choice B, a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires, may involve analyzing literature, but it does not necessarily involve the use of Western scientific methods. Choice D, a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values, may involve comparing literary theories, but it does not necessarily involve the use of Western scientific methods. Choice E, a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture, may involve criticizing Western culture, but it does not necessarily involve the use of Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures.

Therefore, the best answer is Choice C, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.",,,D,0,1156,422,1578,

  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
","  The correct answer is option D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

The author of passage B calls evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory"" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of. In passage A, option D most clearly exemplifies this concept by suggesting that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother's instinct to help her injured child. This idea implies that the mother's behavior is not solely driven by her conscious desire to help her child, but also by an unconscious desire to promote the survival and replication of her genes.

Therefore, option D most clearly illustrates the author of passage B's characterization of evolutionary psychology as a ""conspiracy theory"" because it suggests that human behavior can be explained by underlying genetic interests that are not necessarily apparent or acknowledged by the individual.",,,D,0,1224,236,1460,

  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
","  Answer: D

The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly, as larger businesses can achieve lower costs and drive smaller firms out of business. However, if the size that a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, then it's not necessarily the case that larger businesses will dominate smaller ones in every industry.

For example, in some industries, a business may be able to achieve increasing returns to scale at a relatively small size, while in other industries, a much larger size may be required to achieve the same benefits. This would mean that there is no fixed threshold at which smaller firms are automatically driven out of business, and that the presence of larger firms does not necessarily lead to a monopoly.

Therefore, option D undermines the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that the relationship between size and returns to scale may be more complex and industry-specific than the author implies.",,,E,0,1175,225,1400,

The passage elaborates on Dostoyevsky's view in the most detail, explaining his belief that art should not be limited by the demand to be useful and that a work's artistic merit is the most important factor in determining its value.

Therefore, the best answer is (B): Three positions are presented, and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.

  E: An evolutionary explanation of altruistic behavior may lie in the psychological states brought about in early humans by cues of kinship or familiarity.
","  Answer: E

The main point of Passage A is that altruistic behavior can be explained by evolutionary psychology through the theory of kin selection, which suggests that individuals exhibit altruistic behavior towards genetic relatives in order to increase the chances of survival and replication of shared genes. The passage explains that cues such as physical resemblance can provoke psychological states of identification and empathy, which in turn can increase the chances of related individuals receiving assistance. Therefore, choice E is the best answer, as it accurately states that an evolutionary explanation of altruistic behavior may lie in the psychological states brought about in early humans by cues of kinship or familiarity.

It's worth noting that the other choices do not accurately summarize the main point of Passage A. Choice A is retry because the passage does not mention anything about altruistic behavior diminishing the reproductive success of individuals.

","  I apologize for the confusion. Here's my revised answer:

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, ""El Corrido de Kiansis"" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular ""El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,"" for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: ""I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me."" Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including ""Kiansis,"" which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of ""Gregorio Cortez"" is translated as follows: ""Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez."" The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.

  A: use of exaggeration to embellish Border events

The author's main point in the passage is that wine, unlike other alcoholic beverages, appears to have a number of significant healthful effects that may be tied to certain natural compounds found in grapes. The author argues that scientists have previously studied alcoholic beverages in ways that obscure their healthful effects, and that recent research has shown that moderate wine consumption may have healthful effects such as decreasing the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, reducing platelet adhesiveness, and increasing activity of a natural clot-breaking compound.

  E: Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards iffingerprint identification is to be reliable.
","  Answer: E

The principle that underlies both passages is that fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable. Passage A argues that while there may be some issues with the reliability of fingerprint identification, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability. Passage B, on the other hand, argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints ""match."" There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. The author of Passage B suggests that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and that rigorous tests have shown a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.

In both passages, the authors are concerned with the reliability of fingerprint identification, and they both suggest that objective standards are necessary for it to be considered reliable. Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been reliable in the past, while Passage B argues that there is a lack of objective standards in the present. Therefore, the principle that underlies both passages is that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint identification to be reliable.

","  I'm sorry, but you did not provide any reflection information. Therefore, I cannot help you answer this question using your self-reflection. However, I can give you some guidance on how to approach the question.

The question asks which human characteristic evolutionary psychologists propose a questionable explanation for, according to passage B.

In passage B, the author criticizes evolutionary psychology for offering unpersuasive explanations for certain human behaviors. The author argues that evolutionary psychologists tend to impute an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior is not aware of or does not openly acknowledge.

Therefore, the correct answer would be an example of a human characteristic for which evolutionary psychologists propose an explanation that is questionable or unpersuasive.

Option C, ""forming monogamous families,"" is the best answer. According to passage B, evolutionary psychologists explain monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly by suggesting that it is an interest in the proliferation of genes. However, the author argues that this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care, as there are often many interests that could explain a particular behavior. Therefore, the explanation offered by evolutionary psychologists for forming monogamous families is questionable.

The other options do not fit the criteria for a questionable explanation proposed by evolutionary psychologists. Option A, ""the early human tendency to live in small communities,"" is not discussed in passage B. Option B, ""the slow maturation of human offspring,"" is mentioned in passage B, but the author does not suggest that evolutionary psychologists offer a questionable explanation for it. Option D, ""misinterpreting the interests that motivate human actions,"" is a criticism made by the author against evolutionary psychologists, but it is not a specific human characteristic for which they propose a questionable explanation. Option E, ""caring for some things for their own sakes,"" is also not discussed in passage B.

The author's attitude toward the twofold obligation introduced in lines 20-23 is best described as ""convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers."" The author argues that defense lawyers have a twofold obligation to both their clients and the court, but this does not mean that they should not take every case they are offered. Instead, they should be advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.

The correct answer is D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus.

The author states that ""the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link"" (line 62). The ""relevant evidence"" refers to the clues that were already available to scientists before Meitner's discovery, which they failed to recognize as indicative of nuclear fission. Among the given choices, D is the best match for the ""relevant evidence"" because it refers to a key observation made by Hahn that should have suggested the possibility of nuclear fission. Hahn noted that the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles in a uranium nucleus, which was a crucial hint that the uranium nucleus had split into two smaller nuclei. This observation was a significant piece of evidence that was overlooked by scientists at the time, and it was only recognized as important later, when Meitner made the conceptual connection between the data and the theoretical considerations.

The correct answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

Passage A suggests that law enforcement agencies have the power to decline to prosecute violators of the law, effectively nullifying particular laws or applications of law. The passage also mentions that rules of law are often overinclusive, meaning that they forbid some conduct that the legislature did not intend to forbid.

  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
","  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification.

Passage A states that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent ""points and characteristics"" approach to identification, and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. Passage B, on the other hand, states that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that different examiners use different methods, including point-counting and a more holistic approach. The authors also disagree on the issue of error rates, with Passage A stating that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B states that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study and that a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.

Therefore, option D, the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification, is the best answer.",,,B,0,1155,222,1377,

  E: The corrido is a type of folk song that promotes cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions.
","  The correct answer is E: The corrido is a type of folk song that promotes cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions.

The passage highlights how corridos, a type of narrative folk song, serve to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities through their use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions. The corrido tradition is characterized by its use of standard generic elements, such as ready-made lines and conventional imagery, which reflect and strengthen the continuity of the tradition. The passage also notes that corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Therefore, option E accurately expresses the main point of the passage, which is that corridos promote cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions.

Option A is retry because while the passage does mention that corridos use imagery that is familiar to their listeners, it does not argue that this imagery is the clearest indicator of the unique cohesiveness of Border communities.

Option B is retry because while the passage does mention that corridos have roots in the eighteenth-century Spanish ballad tradition, it does not argue that this is the main point of the passage.

Option C is retry because while the passage does use ""Gregorio Cortez"" as an example of a corrido, it does not argue that this particular corrido is the ideal representation of the form.

The critics argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values, and their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances that cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. Therefore, they would agree with option C, which states that it is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective. This option aligns with the critics' argument that adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to examine and understand cultures is not sufficient to achieve real understanding. Instead, it is necessary to adopt the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied to achieve genuine understanding.",,,B,0,1156,207,1363,

  E: Greater geographical mobility of populations has contributed to the profits of entrepreneurs and investors in technology.
","  The correct answer is option B: Often the desire of some people for profits motivates changes that are beneficial for large numbers of other people.

The passage suggests that entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology are motivated by the prospect of financial rewards, but the benefits of their innovations often extend beyond their own profits and accrue to society at large. The author notes that technological developments have served as a democratizing force, narrowing the gap in benefits between different groups of people. This suggests that the desire for profits can motivate changes that are beneficial for large numbers of people, which aligns with option B.

Option A is retry because the passage does not suggest that the profits derived from computer technology have accrued to fewer people than have the profits derived from any other technological development. In fact, the passage notes that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people.

Option C is retry because while the passage suggests that technology can spread across national boundaries, it does not address the issue of national boundaries as barriers to the democratizing spread of technology.

","  The correct answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.

In this case, the worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The worker's action is motivated by a desire to seek revenge and justice, rather than a careful calculation of the expected utility of the action. The worker believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, and he is acting on his emotions rather than making a rational decision based on economic considerations. Therefore, option E is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

In contrast, options A, B, C, and D all involve rational calculations of the expected utility of the action. The waiter in option A is trying to reduce his taxes by concealing his tip income, which is a rational response to the economic incentive of avoiding taxes. The motorist in option B is avoiding speeding because she knows that the fine for speeding will outweigh any benefits of speeding, which is a rational response to the economic disincentive of the fine. The industrialist in option C is illegally discharging the pollutant because the cost of treatment is greater than the fine, which is a rational response to the economic incentive of minimizing costs. The government official in option D is risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because the inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate, which is a rational response to the economic incentive of supporting herself and her family.

Therefore, option E is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.",,,E,0,1231,497,1728,

","  The answer is C: call attention to the increasing prevalence of industries that have characteristics of the Pin Factory.

The reference to railroads serves to illustrate the increasing prevalence of industries that have characteristics of the Pin Factory, as railroads are an example of an industry that exhibits increasing returns to scale. This is highlighted in the passage as a challenge to the assumption of diminishing returns, which had previously dominated economic theory. The reference to railroads serves to support the idea that increasing returns are a common feature of many industries, and that the Pin Factory is a relevant and important concept in understanding how markets work.

The passage highlights the use of conventional and recognizable imagery in corridos, such as storm imagery, which reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. Additionally, the use of ready-made lines in the despedida, the formal closing verse, suggests that the corrido is composed of both familiar images and certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This suggests that the corrido is unique in its use of language that is familiar to local audiences, supporting choice B.

It is worth noting that choice A, that the dependence of corridos on ready-made lines hindered the efforts of corrido makers to use metaphor effectively, is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention anything about the use of metaphor in corridos, and it does not suggest that the use of ready-made lines hinders the use of metaphor.

However, the passage does not suggest that any insect species have developed complete immunity to plants' secondary substances. Therefore, option E is the best answer.

Option A is retry because the passage does not suggest a direct proportionality between the diversity of secondary substances and the number of insects with which a plant population has interacted.

","  The answer is B: The author of passage B would regard the assumption that any action performed by an early human was necessarily orchestrated by that individual's genes to promote the genes' self-propagation as a mistaken assumption underlying arguments like that made in passage A.

The author of passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for assuming that human behavior can be explained by the interest of genes in propagating themselves, suggesting that this approach imputes an interest to the agent that they may not be aware of. The author implies that this approach oversimplifies the complexity of human behavior and neglects the possibility that humans may have motives that are not instrumental or self-interested. Therefore, the author would likely reject the assumption that early humans' actions were necessarily orchestrated by their genes to promote self-propagation.

Explanation:
The passage states that abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s. Additionally, it mentions that pop art painters were rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it.

The passage suggests that the author would likely agree with this statement because it mentions that wine has healthful effects that are not present in other alcoholic beverages, and that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.

This implies that the author believes that there are beneficial compounds in wine that are not present in other alcoholic beverages, and that these compounds may contribute to the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption. Therefore, the author would likely agree that beer and distilled spirits contain active ingredients other than alcohol whose effects tend to be beneficial.

Dostoyevsky believed that art should be useful, but he rejected the idea that its usefulness could be measured by its ability to serve a particular political view or by its conformity to the demands of radical critics. Instead, he believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit,"" which he defined as ""the ability to express thoughts in characters and images"" so that the reader can fully understand the author's thoughts.

Based on this, the best answer is B: a novel in which the author's ideas are given substance through suitable characters and events. This choice aligns with Dostoyevsky's definition of artistry as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images, and it suggests that the author's ideas are central to the work and are communicated effectively through the characters and events.

The other choices do not align as closely with Dostoyevsky's views. Choice A, a fictionalized account based on interviews with patients, may be a useful work, but it does not necessarily demonstrate the author's ability to express ideas through characters and events. Choice C, a novel in which the author attempted to use allegory to communicate a criticism of feudal society, may be artistic, but it does not necessarily fulfill Dostoyevsky's requirement that the work must be able to stand on its own artistic merit rather than serving a particular political view.

The author also notes that the evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Therefore, the author's primary aim in the passage is to illustrate the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress, highlighting how scientists can overlook crucial evidence and how a new theoretical framework can suddenly illuminate the significance of existing data.

","  The correct answer is (E) ""By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity ..."" (lines 52-54).

The passage highlights the author's admiration for Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its unique narrative structure, which is compared to the art of jazz music. The author notes that the novel's connection to music is not only in its plot but also in the way the story is told, with the narration slipping easily between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism. The author also highlights how Morrison found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, which is analogous to the way Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind.

However, the passage does not provide enough information to justify the answer (E) ""By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity ..."" (lines 52-54) as the correct answer. This line is part of the author's analysis of Morrison's writing style and how it relates to the art of jazz music, but it does not explicitly express the author's attitude towards the novel Jazz. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) ""... Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope .....""

  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
","  Answer: E

The correct answer is E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

The passage criticizes the second version of multicultural education for adopting a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to examine and understand cultures. The critics argue that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. Therefore, option E, which states that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, supports the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Option A, which states that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, is not the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. While this statement may be true, it does not directly address the issue of whether adopting Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is appropriate.

Option B, which states that many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another, does not address the issue of whether the methods of Western science are appropriate for studying non-Western cultures.

Option C, which states that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, does not address the issue of whether the methods of Western science are appropriate for studying non-Western cultures.

Option D, which states that students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations, is not relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

The fourth paragraph explains that the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns - the Pin Factory - are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Therefore, the main purpose of the fourth paragraph is to explain the difficulty associated with modeling the economic assumption of increasing returns, specifically the Pin Factory, and how it has been a challenge for economists to represent it mathematically.

  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
","  Answer: E

The correct answer is E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture.

The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" refers to a collaborative process between people from different cultures, where the written work is based on oral traditions and artifacts of one culture, but written down by a member of another culture. Therefore, option E accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase.

In the passage, the author describes how non-Native American collaborators solicited, translated, recorded, and edited as-told-to life histories of Native Americans, resulting in bicultural composite authorship. This means that the written accounts of Native American life histories were not solely the product of an individual Native American's writing, but were shaped by the cultural perspectives of both the Native American storyteller and the non-Native American writer.

Option A is retry because it implies that the written work is based on artifacts and oral traditions of another culture, but does not specify that the writing itself is done by a member of a different culture. Option B is also retry because it suggests a joint effort by two people from different cultures, whereas the passage describes a collaborative process between a Native American storyteller and a non-Native American writer. Option C is retry because it implies that the identities of the people involved in the collaboration cannot be determined, whereas the passage explicitly states that the collaboration is between non-Native American collaborators and Native American storytellers.
