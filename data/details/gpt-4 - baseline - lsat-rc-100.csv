The author of passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a ""conspiracy theory"" because it explains behavior by attributing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the individual exhibiting the behavior is not aware of. This is most clearly exemplified by the assertion in passage A that ""genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish."" This statement suggests that an individual's seemingly altruistic actions are actually driven by their genes' desire to propagate, even if the individual is not aware of this underlying motive.

The author's connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the idea that larger businesses can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller businesses, driving smaller firms out of business. This leads to an industry being dominated by a few players, creating a monopoly. 
Choice D undermines this connection by suggesting that the size a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This implies that not all large businesses will necessarily achieve lower costs and drive out smaller competitors, weakening the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

  D: pleased that it does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers
  E: convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers
","Thought: 
The author's attitude towards the twofold obligation of defense lawyers (to the defendant and to the court/society) is that it enables them to balance their responsibilities. The author believes that lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, nor should they try to prove the innocence of a client they believe to be guilty. Instead, they should present the case in the client's favor as much as possible, while also considering the facts on the other side and arguing for leniency if they believe it is warranted. This suggests that the author is confident in the twofold obligation's ability to balance the lawyer's responsibilities to both the defendant and the court/society.

The passage primarily discusses the innovative litigation strategies developed by Thurgood Marshall during his time with the NAACP. These strategies, which were initially considered radical, have since been widely adopted in public interest law. The passage does not focus on Marshall's time as a Supreme Court justice or the ideological content of his work. Therefore, the main point of the passage is best captured by the option that emphasizes Marshall's innovative strategies and their lasting impact on public interest law.

The passage discusses how the market system and technological advancements have served as a democratizing force, narrowing the gap in benefits among different groups of people. It mentions that entrepreneurs and investors often cannot maximize their financial success without expanding their market, which involves making their technologies accessible to a larger share of the population. This suggests that the desire for profits can lead to changes that benefit many people.

","Thought: 
The passage discusses how Toni Morrison's novel ""Jazz"" uses a narrative structure that mirrors the structure of a jazz band, particularly the style of Duke Ellington. The author notes that the narrative shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism, much like how a jazz band intertwines its ensemble sound with individual solos. The author also notes that the characters' voices are set off by quotation marks, similar to how jazz musicians perform within the composer's frame. Therefore, the structural analogy between ""Jazz"" and Duke Ellington's style involves more than just the technique of shifting between first-person and third-person narrators.

The passage discusses the corrido, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region. It mentions that corridos use familiar linguistic and thematic conventions, which serve to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. The passage also mentions that corridos use certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, especially in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The passage does not suggest that the use of ready-made lines hindered the use of metaphor, that the language of corridos is familiar mainly to local audiences, that the imagery used in corridos can also be identified in Spanish ballads, or that the reportorial capability of corridos was enhanced by their freedom from the constraints of rhymed ballad forms.

The passage discusses the role of insects in the evolution of secondary substances in plants. It explains that these substances first appeared due to genetic mutations, but their survival and transmission to future generations depended on natural selection. Some secondary substances attracted pollinating insects, while others served as defenses against plant-eating insects. The passage also mentions that insects have evolved to circumvent these defenses. The statement that aligns most closely with this information is that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, but in many instances, insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species.

","Thought: 
The passage suggests that in the future, books will be printed and bound on demand at the point of sale, eliminating the need for warehousing, shipping, and returning unsold books. This implies that the need for warehousing will shift from storing individual books to storing materials needed to print and bind books. The passage does not provide information to support the other options.

","Thought: 
Both passages discuss the reliability of fingerprint identification in relation to the differences in identification practices used by various fingerprint examiners. Passage A mentions the lack of a generally accepted standard for the number of ""points of identification"" required for a positive identification, while Passage B discusses the lack of consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, with some examiners using a ""point-counting"" method and others using a more holistic approach.

","Thought: 
Passage A presents an argument based on evolutionary psychology to explain altruistic behavior in humans. Passage B criticizes this type of argument, suggesting that it oversimplifies human behavior and attributes it to a single interest (the propagation of genes), while ignoring other possible interests or motivations. Therefore, the author of passage B is challenging the reasoning used in passage A.

  C: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

  E: The rate of deliberate crimes will tend to vary inversely with the level of law enforcement.
","Thought: 
The author's argument is based on the principle of utility maximization, which suggests that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction. Therefore, anything that increases the expected utility of lawful activities or decreases the expected utility of criminal activities should reduce the rate of crime. 
Choice C contradicts this principle. It suggests that the rate of deliberate crimes would decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases. This is the opposite of what the author argues. If the expected utility of lawful activities decreases, individuals would be more likely to commit crimes, not less.

","Thought: 
The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" refers to the process where life histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. This suggests that the work was originally created by a member of one culture (Native American) but was then translated, recorded, and edited by a member of another culture (non-Native American).
