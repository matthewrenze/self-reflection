","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice (C) as the most likely objectionable option, but upon further reflection, I realize that it is actually choice (E) that is most likely to be objectionable to proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.

The passage highlights the problem with using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures, as it involves a commitment to objectivity and empirical verifiability, which may not be applicable or relevant to non-Western cultures. Proponents of this version of multicultural education would likely argue that the methods of anthropology and sociology, which are rooted in the Western scientific perspective, are not adequate for understanding non-Western cultures.

Therefore, choice (E) is the most likely objectionable option, as it involves using the methods of Western science to criticize the values of Western culture. This approach is unlikely to be acceptable to proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph, who advocate for a more nuanced and culturally sensitive approach to understanding non-Western cultures.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice (D) as the correct answer, but upon further reflection, I realize that it does not accurately represent what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory."" The passage suggests that evolutionary psychology explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of. This implies that the individual's actions are not necessarily motivated by a genuine desire to promote the well-being of others, but rather by an unconscious desire to propagate their own genes.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (B) Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology. This option most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory,"" as it highlights the challenge of explaining altruistic behavior in terms of genetic self-interest.

Advice: When answering this question, it is essential to carefully read and understand the passage, and to consider the author's arguments and examples.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered question E, ""Marshall's colleagues at the NAACP subsequently revised his methods and extended their applications to areas of law and politics beyond those for which they were designed,"" as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage provides more support for answer C, ""Marshall's tactics were initially opposed by some other members of the NAACP who favored a more traditional approach.""

The passage states that Marshall and the NAACP developed innovations that changed the landscape of public interest law, and that these innovations were initially opposed by some other members of the NAACP who favored a more traditional approach (C). This suggests that Marshall's tactics were not universally accepted within the NAACP, and that there was resistance to his more strategic and methodological approach.

In contrast, the passage does not provide as much support for answer A, ""The ideological motivations for Marshall's work with the NAACP changed during his tenure on the U.S. Supreme Court."" While it is true that Marshall's goals and successes have influenced a wide range of political objectives, the passage does not suggest that his ideological motivations shifted during his time on the Supreme Court.

Similarly, answer B, ""Marshall declined to pursue some cases that were in keeping with the NAACP's goals but whose plaintiffs' likely impression on the public he deemed to be unfavorable,"" is also not supported by the passage. While Marshall may have been selective in the cases he pursued, the passage does not suggest that he declined to pursue cases based on their potential impact on the public.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (A): helped spread the genes responsible for those same behaviors.

Explanation:
The passage explains that altruistic behaviors, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child, are likely the result of evolutionary pressures that promote the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This means that the behavior of helping others is not necessarily unselfish, but rather an evolutionary adaptation that has been shaped by natural selection to promote the spread of genes that are beneficial to the individual and the group.

In contrast, the other options do not accurately describe the reasoning presented in the passage:

* Option (B) is not supported by the passage, as it does not explain how altruistic behaviors could have evolved to promote the survival and replication of genes.
* Option (C) is also not supported, as the passage does not mention anything about the physical health of individuals who exhibit altruistic behaviors.
* Option (D) is not relevant to the passage, as it does not explain how altruistic behaviors could have evolved to help individuals find food.

I previously answered choice (B) as the example of a human characteristic for which evolutionary psychologists propose a questionable explanation. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

The correct answer is choice (C) forming monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists argue that humans form monogamous families because of their interest in propagating their genes. However, as the passage notes, this explanation is questionable because there are other interests that could explain this behavior, such as a concern for the welfare of one's children.

I previously answered question D, which states ""In his work with the NAACP during the 1940s and 1950s, Marshall adopted a set of tactics that were previously considered a radical departure from accepted practice, but which he adapted in such a way that they eventually became accepted conventions in the field of law."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is B: ""The litigation strategies that Marshall devised in pursuit of the NAACP's civil rights goals during the 1940s and 1950s constituted significant innovations that have since been adopted as standard tactics for public interest lawyers.""

The passage highlights Marshall's development of strategic and methodological innovations in public interest law, which have been widely adopted by subsequent generations of lawyers. The author notes that Marshall's work with the NAACP, while initially considered radical, eventually became accepted conventions in the field of law. This is supported by the passage's emphasis on the explicit recognition of the importance of selecting the right plaintiff in a public interest legal campaign, as well as the use of sociological and psychological statistics to persuade courts to rule in favor of the NAACP's goals.

Therefore, the main point of the passage is that Marshall's innovative strategies for litigation have had a lasting impact on the field of public interest law, and have been widely adopted by subsequent generations of lawyers. Answer B best captures this main point.

Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmmed, it went ""against all previous experiences of nuclear physics,"" but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term ""nuclear fission,"" she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Explanation:
The passage describes two sides of a debate in the legal community regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. One side believes that changing societal norms and institutions can reduce crime, while the other side believes that increasing penalties and law enforcement is the best deterrent. The passage then introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, which shows that these two positions are not fundamentally in conflict. The principle states that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice, and that the two deterrence methods have the same overall effect.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice B, as the passage describes two sides of a debate and applies an economic principle to decide between them.",,,A,0,1103,237,1340,

I previously answered choice (A) - enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible - as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not correct. Passage A suggests that capricious enforcement is not a desirable solution to the problem of overinclusive laws, as it would result in the punishment of innocent people. Instead, the passage suggests that selective nonenforcement, or the use of discretionary nonenforcement, is a more appropriate solution. Therefore, the correct answer is choice (B) - enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws.

Explanation:
Passage A highlights the problem of overinclusive laws, which can result in the punishment of innocent people. The passage suggests that law enforcement agencies have the power to effectively nullify particular laws or applications of law by declining to prosecute violators. However, this power can lead to capricious enforcement, which is undesirable. Instead, the passage suggests that selective nonenforcement, or the use of discretionary nonenforcement, is a more appropriate solution. This approach allows law enforcement agencies to focus their resources on the areas of conduct that have been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule, while avoiding the punishment of innocent people.

This evidence supports the theory that wine may have health benefits, and the author provides examples of studies that have found these effects.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) - provide evidence for the theory that moderate wine consumption ameliorates factors that contribute to premature heart disease.

Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about

Action: Answer(""B"")

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that the authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood of a fingerprint examiner incorrectly declaring a match in a given criminal case. The passage highlights the lack of objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches, and the authors note that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. They also mention that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and that some proficiency tests have shown examiners making few or no errors, but these tests have been criticized as lax. Therefore, the authors are likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the likelihood of examiners making errors in their assessments.

Keywords:

* Fingerprint examiners
* Error rate
* Identification
* Ridge characteristics
* Point counting
* Holistic approach
* Proficiency tests
* Errors

Solution:
The authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood of a fingerprint examiner incorrectly declaring a match in a given criminal case.

The correct answer is choice (C) It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective. This is because the critic argues that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical, which is value-laden and may not provide a comprehensive understanding of non-Western cultures. Therefore, it is essential to adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied to achieve real understanding.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option C: accumulation of financial assets in investments. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option E: generally acknowledged social status in a community.

The passage highlights the democratizing effect of technological advancements, which refers to the process of making new technology accessible to a wider range of people. This is achieved through the market system, which drives prices down and makes technologies more affordable for a larger share of the population. The passage does not mention anything about equalizing the distribution of tangible and intangible goods (option A), creating new technology (option B), or participating in the regulation of society through public or private institutions (option D).

Therefore, the correct answer is option E: generally acknowledged social status in a community. The passage does not provide any information about how the democratization of technology affects social status, but it is reasonable to assume that as technology becomes more accessible, social status may become more equalized as well.

The passage suggests that Morrison's use of narrative techniques inspired by jazz in Jazz allows individual characters' voices to be difficult to distinguish, much like how individual musicians' voices merge in ensemble jazz playing. This is evident in the way the narrator slips easily between the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice and the first-person lyricism of key characters. The structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional style involves more than just the technique of shifting between first-person and third-person narrators, as the novel also mimics the way in which individual musicians' voices blend together in ensemble playing.

Instead, it provides examples of autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans, which were shaped by their cultural perspectives and the intercultural collaboration that occurred.

Explanation:
The third paragraph provides examples of various modes of autobiographical expression used by early Native Americans, including songs, chants, stories, dance, drama, and visual arts. These examples are used to support the argument that autobiography in pre-contact Native American cultures was not solely a written tradition, but also included oral and visual modes of expression. The passage highlights the inclusive nature of identity in these cultures, which was relational to society, landscape, and the cosmos, and the cultural constructs of highly diverse Native American peoples. The examples provided in the third paragraph serve to illustrate and reinforce this argument, making option C the best answer.

In contrast, option A is incorrect because the third paragraph does not refute any traditional interpretations of artifacts.

Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (C) The demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model.

The passage suggests that literary agents will play a crucial role in the transition to the new digital model. The author notes that literary agents marketing new manuscripts will demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors, which will put pressure on traditional publishers to accommodate higher royalty payments. This implies that the demands of literary agents will be a driving force in the transition to the new digital model.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that passage B presents a more tentative and nuanced view of fingerprint identification compared to passage A. While passage A is more conclusive and optimistic about the reliability of fingerprint identification, passage B acknowledges the limitations and uncertainties of the technique.

In passage B, the author notes that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating matches, and the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown.

Reasoning: The passage does not express any strong emotions towards the idea of the Pin Factory model being part of the mainstream of economic thought. It simply states that the idea has been ""underground"" for a long time and has only recently gained acceptance in the mainstream.

Re-evaluation:
After re-reading the passage, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect. The author's attitude towards the idea of the Pin Factory model being part of the mainstream of economic thought could most accurately be described as one of curiosity (C).

This suggests that the primary purpose of the passage is to clarify the artist's motivations and intentions, rather than simply expressing curiosity about their work.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice (C) as the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

The correct answer is choice (E) ""A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.""

Explanation:
The utility maximization principle suggests that individuals will make decisions based on the expected utility of their actions. In this case, the worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The worker's actions are not motivated by a desire to maximize their overall satisfaction or utility, but rather by a desire to punish their former supervisor for what they perceive as an unfair dismissal. This decision is not driven by a rational calculation of the costs and benefits of the action, but rather by emotions and personal biases.

Therefore, choice (E) is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Advice:
When answering the question, it is important to carefully consider the rationality of the individual's decision-making process. In this case, the worker's decision to physically assault their former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as it is driven by emotions and personal biases rather than a desire to maximize overall satisfaction or utility.",,,E,0,1248,350,1598,

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option (B) as the best answer. Upon further reflection, I realize that the reference to railroads in the passage serves to highlight the difficulty economists faced in trying to incorporate the concept of the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought. The passage states that ""many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads"" (emphasis added). The reference to railroads is used to illustrate the challenge of mathematically representing the concept of the Pin Factory, which was seen as a major obstacle in incorporating it into economic theory.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) [REDACTED]. Options (A) and (C) are not supported by the passage, and option (B) is partially correct, as the reference to railroads does [REDACTED], but it also serves to highlight the broader challenge of incorporating the Pin Factory into economic theory. Option (E) is not relevant to the passage.

""I believe the best answer is (B) respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence. The passage highlights Lichtenstein's use of comic-art conventions and his ability to reconcile different art forms, suggesting that the artist's work is successful in its parody of popular culture. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not fully capture the author's attitude towards Lichtenstein's work. While the author does acknowledge the success of Lichtenstein's parody, the passage also suggests that the artist's work has a deeper level of meaning and intentionality beyond mere parody. The author writes that Lichtenstein's work displays an 'impulse toward realism' and an 'urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.' This suggests that the author has a more nuanced view of Lichtenstein's work than simply admiring its parodic qualities.

Initial Answer: E: skepticism toward its assumptions about the brain

Reasoning: The passage presents the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels as a significant breakthrough in understanding how chemical signals are transmitted in the brain. However, the author also acknowledges that the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is not yet fully understood, and that more research is needed to realize the full potential of this discovery. This suggests that the author has some skepticism toward the assumptions made about the brain and its functioning.

Correct Answer: B: optimism about its potential applications

Explanation: The passage presents the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels as a significant breakthrough with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of brain disorders. The author highlights the possibility of designing drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons, which could selectively impede or enhance certain effects. This suggests that the author is optimistic about the potential applications of this discovery.

Reasoning: The passage states that Marshall's test case strategy involved sponsoring litigation of tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage does not necessarily imply that the test case strategy was necessary.

I previously answered question E, but upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is B: The corrido is unique among ballad forms because it uses language that is familiar mainly to local audiences.

Error Keywords:
* A: In at least some cases, the dependence of corridos on ready-made lines hindered the efforts of corrido makers to use metaphor effectively. (This is not supported by the passage, which highlights the use of metaphors in corridos.)
* D: The reportorial capability of corridos was probably enhanced by their freedom from the constraints of rhymed ballad forms. (While it is true that corridos lack rhyme schemes, the passage does not suggest that this is a significant factor in their reportorial capability.)

Solution:
The passage suggests that the use of familiar language and imagery in corridos is a key factor in their ability to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. The author notes that corridos use ""familiar linguistic and thematic conventions"" and that figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, but when used, they incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. This suggests that the use of familiar language and imagery is a unique aspect of the corrido tradition compared to other ballad forms.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

The passage suggests that secondary substances in plants have evolved as a result of genetic mutations, and that natural selection has favored those substances that are beneficial to the plant, such as attracting pollinators or defending against insect enemies. This means that the presence of secondary substances in plants is not a direct response to insects, but rather a result of the plant's own evolutionary history.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage is not primarily concerned with advocating for a particular method of treatment. Rather, it is focused on presenting scientific evidence and research findings related to the effects of wine consumption on cardiovascular health. The author is presenting the results of studies and experiments, rather than promoting a particular agenda.

Correct answer: C, ""correcting a scientific misconception."" The passage is primarily concerned with correcting the misconception that all forms of alcohol have the same effects on the body, and that wine is no different from other alcoholic beverages. The author presents evidence to show that wine consumption has different effects on the body than other forms of alcohol, and that these effects may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.",,,C,0,1072,299,1371,

","  Reflection:
I previously answered question E, which states that critics of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding claim these proposals are not value neutral and are therefore unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is C: Proponents of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding claim that it is not enough to refrain from judging non-Western cultures if the methods used to study these cultures are themselves Western.

The passage highlights the limitations of the first proposal, which focuses on teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture. The critics argue that this approach is flawed because it assumes that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are already value-laden and biased towards the values of the majority culture. Therefore, the second proposal, which adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, is more appropriate.

The main point of the passage is that the methods used to study cultures are crucial in achieving a genuine understanding of non-Western cultures. The passage suggests that simply refraining from judging these cultures is not enough; the methods used to study them must be adapted to the cultural context in which they are studied.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Proponents of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding claim that it is not enough to refrain from judging non-Western cultures if the methods used to study these cultures are themselves Western.",,,E,0,1248,341,1589,

I previously answered that over time, abstract expressionism moved from intensity to lyricism, which is incorrect. After reflecting on my mistake, I realized that the correct answer is that abstract expressionism moved from abstraction to realism.

The passage states that by the time pop art emerged in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. This suggests that abstract expressionism was initially characterized by abstraction, but over time, it moved towards realism. The passage also mentions that Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. This further supports the inference that abstract expressionism moved towards realism.

","  Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.

  A: Scientists should not attempt to study the possible healthful effects of moderate consumption of beer and distilled spirits.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) ""It introduces two aspects of Marshall's career and outlines the historical significance of both.""

The passage highlights two main functions of the first sentence:

1. Introducing the topic of the passage, which is Thurgood Marshall's work with the NAACP.
2. Establishing the historical significance of Marshall's career, particularly his innovations in public interest law.

The sentence does not dispute a claim or summarize Marshall's achievements, as option (A) suggests. It also does not establish the controversial nature of Marshall's ideologies, as option (B) implies. Option (C) most accurately describes the functions of the first sentence.

The passage suggests that the physicists conducting the experiments were not using the same research techniques, as they were not receptive to the possibility that atoms could be split through neutron bombardment. This lack of awareness and receptiveness to new ideas is highlighted in the passage when it states that ""a common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse."" This view shows that the physicists were not considering the possibility of nuclear fission, and therefore were not using the same research techniques.

The passage highlights the significance of music in the novel, particularly in the way the story is told.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the author of passage A would be most likely to agree with option B: At least the plan would have a lower social cost than would turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time.

Explanation:
The author of passage A is concerned with the overinclusive nature of laws and the costs associated with enforcing them literally. The plan described in passage B, which involves selectively cutting off water to high-income neighborhoods, is likely to be seen as a violation of the principle of nonenforcement, which the author advocates for. By targeting specific neighborhoods, the plan creates a loophole that could be seen as a violation of the rule of law.

Furthermore, the author may argue that the plan is not a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules, as it does not address the root cause of the problem. Instead, the author may suggest that specific laws regarding the payment of water bills should be introduced to provide a more effective set of incentives.

In conclusion, the author of passage A would likely agree that the plan described in passage B is not a suitable solution to the problem of water delinquencies, as it violates the principle of nonenforcement and does not address the root cause of the problem.",,,B,0,1257,341,1598,

The correct answer is option E, ""Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture."" This answer is the strongest objection because it highlights the importance of adopting the perspective and methods of the culture being studied in order to truly understand it. The passage argues that simply using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is not sufficient for genuine understanding, as these methods are value-laden and may not capture the full complexity of non-Western cultures.

In contrast, option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values, which may not address the issue of Western cultural chauvinism. Option A is incorrect because it implies that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, which is not necessarily true. Option B is also incorrect because it does not directly address the issue of Western cultural chauvinism.

Explanation:
The passage states that ""the digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory,"" which means that there will be no need for warehousing or storage of physical books.

  A: A person who is born into one tribe but is brought up by members of another tribe retains a name given at birth.
  B: A pictograph that represents a specific person incorporates the symbol for a constellation.
  C: A similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities.
  D: A name given to one member of a community cannot be given to another member of the same community.
  E: A decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe.
","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice (A) as the most consistent with the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not correct.

The passage suggests that identity in pre-contact Native American cultures was markedly inclusive and relational, extending beyond individual identity to include society, landscape, and the cosmos. This means that the expression of personal history was not solely focused on individual experiences but also incorporated the perspectives and contributions of the broader community.

Therefore, the most consistent answer is choice (C), which suggests that a similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities. This aligns with the idea that identity in pre-contact Native American cultures was shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people and the broader community.

I apologize for my earlier mistake and hope this revised answer is more accurate.",,,B,0,1169,206,1375,
