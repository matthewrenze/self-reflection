","Based on the self-reflection, the critics discussed in the third paragraph would most likely object to a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society with different values. This directly involves judging one culture by another culture's standards, which goes against the critics' view that real understanding of a culture requires adopting that culture's own perspectives and methods.
The other choices, while potentially problematic in some ways, do not as directly exemplify what the critics are arguing against.

","You're right, upon further reflection, the passage does present three positions on the role of art and literature, but focuses primarily on differentiating Dostoyevsky's third view from the second, more radical view. The first view that art should be above everyday reality is mentioned but not elaborated on in detail.
Dostoyevsky's perspective is explained at length - that reality is literature's source but reality is more than the tangible, that art should be judged on artistic merit rather than political utility, and that art's usefulness can't always be precisely measured. This is contrasted point-by-point with the radical view that art must depict concrete reality ""as it is"" and serve a clear sociopolitical purpose to be valuable.
So in summary, while three positions are introduced, the passage focuses on fleshing out Dostoyevsky's view and specifically differentiating it from the second radical perspective. The first view is more of a brief setup and not dwelled upon.

Both passages agree that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable. Passage A acknowledges the lack of fully uniform standards specifying the number of matching points required for identification, but argues fingerprint evidence should still be admissible given its long history of use. In contrast, Passage B sees the lack of objective standards as a critical flaw that makes fingerprint evidence unreliable.

2. Due to this obligation, lawyers should not present false assertions or try to prove the innocence of clients they know are guilty. 
3. The author believes the ""best defense"" comes from a lawyer convinced of the case's merits after careful analysis.
4. The twofold obligation doesn't mean lawyers must take every case offered.
5. The author does not suggest the twofold obligation creates a conflict of interest or prevents effective representation.
Considering these points, the author seems convinced the twofold obligation is compatible with, and in fact enables, defense lawyers to properly balance their responsibilities to defendants and the court/society. It does not create an inherent conflict of interest in the author's view.

This indicates Passage B has a more general focus on the broader implications and issues surrounding fingerprint evidence.
In contrast, Passage A is more narrowly focused on the specific court case and defendant's challenges to the fingerprint evidence used in his particular trial.

  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
The passage discusses several key points about proverbs and their use in Mexican American communities:
1. Proverbs are self-contained sayings that carry wisdom or a message, and can be understood independent of specific verbal context. 
2. However, the meaning of each proverb use varies based on the individual speaker and social context.
3. Proverb use in Mexican American communities often serves a didactic purpose, especially in instructing youth.
4. Proverbs help foster ethnic consciousness and maintain ties to Mexican culture and tradition.
Looking at the answer choices:
A is incorrect. The passage does not state or imply that proverbs used for table manners have the primary purpose of maintaining ethnic ties.
B is tempting, but too broad. While the passage says proverbs can enhance familiarity with Mexican heritage, it does not say frequent proverb use in any community necessarily conveys ethnicity to children.
C is not supported. The passage focuses on Mexican American proverb use and does not compare it to use by other Spanish speakers worldwide.
D matches the key points from the first two paragraphs - proverbs are self-contained and understood independent of verbal context, but their meaning in each use depends on the social context. This is most strongly implied by the passage.
E is unsupported. While the passage notes an emphasis on peer relationships, it does not say this distinguishes Mexican American communities from others in the US.

  E: present an example of the high levels of competition achieved in transportation industries
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage discusses two key economic concepts that are in tension with each other: the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) and the Invisible Hand (perfect competition enabled by diminishing returns).
2. Economists historically focused more on the Invisible Hand concept because diminishing returns were easier to model mathematically than increasing returns. 
3. However, the passage notes that many real-world industries are actually characterized by increasing returns, like the Pin Factory concept describes. 
4. The railroad industry is specifically called out as an example of an industry with increasing returns to scale.
5. By providing this example, the author is illustrating that the Invisible Hand concept emphasized by economists has shortcomings, because it fails to account for the reality of industries like railroads that have increasing returns.
Therefore, the best answer is (D) - the reference to railroads points to an industry that illustrates the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand.
The railroad example is not being used to resolve ambiguity in the Invisible Hand metaphor (A), illustrate the mathematical difficulty of the Pin Factory concept (B), highlight the prevalence of Pin Factory-like industries (C), or show high competition in transportation (E). The key purpose is to demonstrate a real-world case that contradicts the Invisible Hand assumptions.

The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain cultural chauvinism.

Looking at the answer choices:
A: If it's impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, then the critics' proposed solution of studying cultures using their own internal methods would not be feasible. This directly challenges the criticism.

D: The ability of Western students to understand their own culture's achievements is not relevant to the criticism about how to study non-Western cultures.
