The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education, which argues for a neutral stance towards different cultures. However, it still uses Western methods of examination, which critics argue are already value-laden and can distort the understanding of non-Western cultures. Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would likely be objectionable to proponents of this version of multicultural education.

The author connects increased size with monopoly power by arguing that larger businesses can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller businesses, driving smaller firms out of business and leading to monopoly. To undermine this connection, we need to find an option that shows that increased size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power.

The passage presents three positions on the role of art and literature. The first two positions are briefly described, while the third position, which is Dostoyevsky's, is elaborated in detail. The passage differentiates Dostoyevsky's position from the other two, but it does not explicitly state that his position is superior or inferior to the others. Therefore, the organization of the material in the passage is best described as presenting three positions and differentiating the third from the first two in detail.
