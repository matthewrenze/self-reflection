  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The third paragraph discusses critics of the second version of multicultural education. These critics argue that using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
2. According to these critics, real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied, which are often nonscientific.
3. Looking at the choices:
   A. This study compares moral codes but doesn't specify the methods used, so it's unclear if it would be objectionable.
   B. This study uses the culture's own literature to understand its values, which aligns with the critics' view.
   C. This study uses Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture, which is exactly what the critics object to.
   D. This study uses one society's literary theories to criticize another society's literature, which the critics might object to, but it's not as clear-cut as choice C.
   E. This study uses Western methods to criticize Western culture, which is not what the critics are concerned about.
4. Choice C most directly represents what the critics in the third paragraph would find objectionable.

  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
","To determine which assertion from passage A best exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory"", let's break it down:
1. The author of passage B states that evolutionary psychology explains behavior by attributing an interest (propagation of genes) that the agent of the behavior is unaware of or does not acknowledge.
2. The author provides an example: a parent's interest in their child's well-being is actually the genes' ""conspiracy"" to propagate themselves.
3. Looking at the choices from passage A:
A) This is a general statement about evolutionary psychology's approach and does not exemplify the ""conspiracy theory"" idea.
B) This states that altruism is a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology but does not provide a specific example of the ""conspiracy theory"" concept.
C) This describes altruistic behavior but does not connect it to the propagation of genes.
D) This statement suggests that genes may promote their own propagation through actions that appear unselfish, which aligns with the ""conspiracy theory"" concept described in passage B.

","To determine which choice would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, I'll analyze each option:
A) This suggests that monopoly power can exist without being the largest business, which somewhat weakens the size-monopoly link. However, it's limited to specific regions.
B) Worker salaries are not directly related to the connection between business size and monopoly power.
C) Collusion among a few large players mimicking monopoly pricing actually supports the idea that increased size leads to monopoly-like conditions.
D) Variability in the size needed for increasing returns across industries doesn't necessarily undermine the general principle that increased size leads to monopoly power.
E) If specialization gains are offset by other costs as a business grows, this would directly undermine the argument that increased size leads to increasing returns and thus monopoly power. It suggests there may be limits to the benefits of increased scale.
Therefore, choice E most directly challenges the link between increased business size and monopoly power that the author describes.

1. The passage introduces two opposing positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time:
   a) Art should stand above everyday reality
   b) Art should be grounded in concrete reality and contribute to creating a new society (be useful)
2. Dostoyevsky's third position is then introduced. The rest of the passage elaborates on his view:
   - As a realist, he believed reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was deeper
   - He saw no distinction between fantasy and reality
   - Reality is shaped by the person who experiences it
   - The task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world
   - Art should be judged on its ""artistic merit"", not its political utility
   - Artistic merit means the ability to express thoughts well in characters and images
   - The usefulness of art can't always be measured precisely
3. Dostoyevsky's position is differentiated in detail from the two introduced at the beginning, especially the radical view that art must be useful.
Therefore, the passage presents three positions, and the third (Dostoyevsky's) is differentiated from the first two in detail.

2. It explains behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior.
3. Altruistic behavior, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child, may have evolved because it increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.
4. As human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, applying altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms.

","To determine the author's attitude towards the scientists discussed in the first paragraph, let's analyze the relevant statements:
1. The author states that most scientists studying the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages ""have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol.""
2. Because of this assumption, the author notes that these scientists ""have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages.""

","To determine the most likely meaning of ""defined categories of neurons"", let's analyze the relevant information in the passage:
1. Researchers have discovered that receptors for neurotransmitters contain a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
2. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, collectively known as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
3. Each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties, so a receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than the same receptor in another part of the brain.
4. This discovery raises the possibility of highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders by designing drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons.
Based on this information, ""defined categories of neurons"" most likely refers to neurons that influence particular brain functions (choice D). The passage suggests that different varieties of receptors are found in different parts of the brain, implying that they have distinct functions. By targeting specific receptors on these neurons, drugs could potentially treat specific brain disorders, indicating that the neurons are categorized based on their functions.

","To determine which choice would most call into question the author's assertion in lines 11-16, let's first identify that assertion:
The author asserts that while many African American writers have used music and musicians as themes and metaphors in their writing, Toni Morrison was the first to use a musical genre (jazz) as the structuring principle for an entire novel in her 1992 work Jazz.
Now let's examine each choice:
A) This choice supports the author's assertion by stating that Morrison intentionally simulated jazz performance style in Jazz. It does not call the assertion into question.
B) If a small number of African American novelists had based their work on blues music structure earlier in the 20th century, it would contradict the author's claim that Morrison was the first to use a musical genre as a novel's structuring principle. This choice could call the assertion into question.
C) This is a broad generalization about all novels dealing with arts and artists. It does not specifically address African American writers or the use of musical genres as structural principles, so it does not directly challenge the author's assertion.
D) The idea that any novel can be considered musical to some degree is a broad claim that does not specifically address the author's assertion about African American writers and the use of musical genres as structural principles.
E) The relative number of African American writers versus non-African American writers who have written music-themed novels does not affect the author's specific assertion about the groundbreaking nature of Morrison's use of jazz as a structural principle in her novel.
The choice that would most call into question the author's assertion is B, as it suggests Morrison may not have been the first African American author to use a musical genre as a novel's structuring principle.

2. Recently, some researchers questioned this assumption and investigated moderate wine consumption.
3. They found wine consumption slows alcohol absorption compared to spirits, and moderate wine consumption correlates with decreased deaths from premature heart disease.
4. Possible explanations: wine increases clot-breaking compounds, prevents damage from high lipid levels, decreases blood vessel wall thickness, and reduces platelet adhesiveness. 
5. A study showing decreased platelet adhesiveness from grape juice suggests wine's healthful effects may come from natural compounds in grapes not present in other alcoholic beverages.

","To determine the principle underlying the arguments in both passages, I'll analyze the main points of each:
Passage A:
- Argues that fingerprint evidence should be admissible despite lack of scientific testing
- Cites the long history of fingerprint evidence use in trials as evidence of reliability
- Acknowledges lack of uniform standards but argues fingerprint examiners still follow a consistent approach
- Concludes the trial court was right to accept testimony that fingerprint ID has a low error rate
Passage B:
- Argues there are no objective standards for declaring fingerprint matches
- Points out the lack of data on how likely partial prints from different people could match
- Contends that without this data, the value of fingerprint evidence can't be properly assessed
- Cites the lack of studies on error rates and suggests some proficiency tests are not rigorous enough
The common thread is that both passages discuss the need to know the likelihood of partial prints from different people matching in order to properly evaluate fingerprint evidence. Passage A dismisses this concern by citing the long history of fingerprint evidence use, while Passage B emphasizes it as a critical flaw. But both acknowledge this as a key issue.

  D: Some species of plants produce only one such substance.
  E: A few of them act as regulators of plants'
","To determine which answer choice is most strongly supported by the passage, let's review the key points about secondary substances in plants:
1. Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that are not required for plant growth or metabolism.
2. They give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
3. New secondary substances can appear as a result of genetic mutations in individual plants.
4. Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects, while others serve as defenses against plant-eating insects.
5. Insects evolve to circumvent plants' defenses and identify suitable food sources by their characteristic flavors or odors.
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:
A: The passage states that new secondary substances ""continue to appear"" as a result of genetic mutations, suggesting that some are indeed the results of recent mutations. This choice is strongly supported.
B: The passage indicates that secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, not that they typically contribute to only one or the other. This choice is not supported.
C: The passage does not mention any chemical reactions between secondary substances and substances produced by insects. This choice is not supported.
D: The passage does not specify that some species of plants produce only one secondary substance. This choice is not supported.

  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
","Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The passage discusses how communication between neurons was once thought to be purely electrical, but evidence has shown it is actually chemical, via neurotransmitters.
2. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors, causing the receiving neuron to become permeable to ions, which generates an electrical impulse in the receiving neuron.
3. Recent evidence shows that these receptors contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and an ion channel, and binding of the neurotransmitter causes the receptor to change shape and open the ion channel.
4. Several types of these receptors have been found, collectively known as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, and each type has several varieties with slightly different properties in different parts of the brain.
5. This raises the possibility of designing drugs to target specific receptors on certain neurons, potentially helping to treat various brain disorders.
Looking at the answer choices:
A and B are incomplete, as they don't mention the mechanism of how the receptors work or the potential for selective treatment.
C is incorrect, as it doesn't mention the potential for selective treatment, which is a key point.
E is incomplete, as it doesn't mention the chemical transmission of impulses, only focusing on the receptor differences and treatment potential.

","To determine which word in Passage A is most closely related to the role of ""selectively"" in Passage B, let's analyze the context and meaning of ""selectively"" in Passage B.
In Passage B, ""selectively"" is used to describe how the city officials plan to cut water to a few residences with outstanding bills, specifically targeting high-income neighborhoods. This selective enforcement is meant to make an example of privileged residents who have not paid their water bills.
Now, let's examine the words in Passage A:
A. ""particularly"" (line 12): This word is used to describe how the legislature tries to describe forbidden conduct. It does not relate to selective enforcement.
B. ""probability"" (line 17): This word is used in the context of punishing the innocent to reduce the probability of acquitting the guilty. It does not relate to selective enforcement.
C. ""alternative"" (line 22): This word is used to describe alternative methods of law enforcement that could reduce the danger of punishing the innocent. It does not relate to selective enforcement.
D. ""discretionary"" (line 23): This word is used to describe the technique of ""discretionary nonenforcement"" by which law enforcement agencies can reduce the costs of overinclusive rules. This is closely related to the selective enforcement described in Passage B.

","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the relevant information from passage B:
1. Evolutionary psychology is described as a ""conspiracy theory"" that explains behavior by attributing an interest (propagating genes) that the agent is unaware of.
2. The passage questions the evolutionary psychologists' claim that humans form monogamous families because of an interest in propagating genes. It suggests that while this interest could explain the behavior, other interests could also explain it.
3. The passage argues that for an interest to decisively explain a behavior, the behavior must only be reasonable if one had that specific interest. However, such cases are rare.
4. It concludes that not all motives can be instrumental and that there must be some things one cares for just for their own sake.
Looking at the answer choices:
A, B, and E are mentioned in the passage but are not presented as questionable explanations by evolutionary psychologists.
D is a general statement about misinterpreting interests, but not a specific human characteristic.

  E: convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers
","To determine the author's attitude towards the twofold obligation of defense lawyers, let's analyze the relevant parts of the passage:
1. The author states that defense lawyers have an obligation not only to the defendant, but also to the court and society.
2. Because of this twofold obligation, lawyers should not present assertions to the court that they know to be false, even if it would benefit their client.
3. When lawyers are certain their client is guilty, they should not try to demonstrate their innocence. Instead, they should argue for leniency in sentencing if warranted.
4. The author believes that the ""best defense"" can only be provided by a lawyer who is convinced of the merits of the case after careful analysis.
5. Lawyers should not take every case they are offered, as they are not mere mouthpieces for defendants, but advocates for the defendants' rights given the facts.
Considering these points, the author seems to believe that the twofold obligation helps lawyers balance their responsibilities to both the defendant and the court/society. The author is confident that this obligation ensures lawyers do not make false assertions or represent clients they know to be guilty, while still advocating for the defendants' rights based on the facts of the case.

  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage discusses experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium between 1934 and 1939. During this time, scientists were compiling increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing.
2. In 1938, Otto Hahn informed Lise Meitner of a surprising result: barium was conclusively identified as one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium. This was surprising because barium's structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism Hahn envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
3. Hahn also noted that the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium (the accompanying product) added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.
4. Meitner recognized the significance of this data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
5. When scientists rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
The ""relevant evidence"" here seems to refer to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939. This includes Hahn's findings about barium and technetium, which Meitner recognized as evidence of nuclear fission.

1. The passage discusses how digital publishing is likely to supplant or rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience.
2. It mentions that traditional publishers, heavily invested in traditional publishing infrastructure, will initially be reluctant to pay higher royalties to authors, as demanded by literary agents in the digital publishing model.
3. This reluctance will lead to upstart digital-publishing firms having the first opportunity to bid for new manuscripts.
4. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce redundant functions to accommodate higher royalty payments or risk losing their authors.
The final sentence states: ""Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.""

","To determine Dostoyevsky's view, let's analyze the relevant parts of the passage:
1. Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality. This suggests he disagreed with the radical critics' view that reality should be depicted ""as it is"".
2. He thought the radical critics' demand to depict reality ""as it is"" was meaningless, because reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
3. He believed the task of the writer was to ""explode the boundaries of the so-called real world"", suggesting reality goes beyond the merely tangible.
Among the given choices, the one that best captures Dostoyevsky's view is:
A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
This aligns with his belief that reality is shaped by the person who experiences it, and that there is no clear distinction between fantasy and reality.
The other choices do not accurately reflect Dostoyevsky's views as presented in the passage.

","To determine the primary reason the author mentions ""crimes of passion"", let's analyze the context:
1. The passage is about determining effective ways to deter deliberate crimes like fraud.
2. ""Crimes of passion"" are mentioned as a contrast to deliberate crimes. The author states ""Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion...""
3. By providing this contrast, the author helps define what deliberate crimes are - they are not impulsive like crimes of passion, but rather planned and intentional.
4. The other choices don't fit as well:
   - A is incorrect because crimes of passion are not deliberate crimes.
   - C, D, and E are not the primary reason for mentioning crimes of passion in this context.
Therefore, the best answer is B - the author mentions ""crimes of passion"" primarily to provide a contrast that helps define what deliberate crimes are.

  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the relevant information from the passage:
1. Before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei was experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart in principle.
2. However, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
3. The by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
4. More significantly, the by-products remained unidentified because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
Analyzing the answer choices:
A. The passage suggests that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments indicating that atoms could be split. This aligns with the information provided.
B. The passage does not mention that the physics community reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
C. The passage states that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified, but not that they were never identified.

  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
","To determine the most likely meaning of ""capricious enforcement"" based on the passage, let's analyze the relevant information:
1. The passage states that rules of law are often overinclusive, forbidding some conduct that the legislature did not intend to forbid.
2. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose heavy social costs, like punishing an innocent person.
3. Discretionary nonenforcement is a technique that can reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion (loopholes).
4. The passage suggests that capricious enforcement, while not unknown or rare, does not appear to be the central tendency because legislative oversight ensures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation.
Based on this information, ""capricious enforcement"" most likely refers to enforcing the law in a way that does not align with the legislature's intent. The passage contrasts capricious enforcement with the idea that legislative oversight prevents agencies from straying too far from the intended regulation.

  E: The only reasonable solution to the problem of overdue water bills in the city is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes.
","To determine which statement can be inferred from passage B, let's analyze each choice:
A: The passage states that 231,000 water customers are late paying their bills, but it doesn't provide the total number of water customers in the city. Therefore, we can't infer that most customers are late.
B: The passage doesn't indicate that most residences with outstanding bills are in high-income neighborhoods. It only states that officials plan to target high-income neighborhoods to make examples of a few privileged residents.
C: The passage doesn't suggest that it's appropriate to turn off water for high-income residents who pay a few days late. It only mentions targeting high-income neighborhoods to make examples of those with outstanding bills.
D: The passage states that officials are ""planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts."" This implies that the city has rarely, if ever, turned off water for late-paying customers in recent years. If it were a common practice, there would be no need to demonstrate seriousness by cutting off water to a few residences.
E: While the passage mentions a loophole that prevents water charges from being subject to liens, it doesn't state that classifying water bills as taxes is the only reasonable solution. In fact, it questions why the law can't simply be changed to close the loophole.

  E: refute the argument that science should take cues from popular beliefs
","To determine the author's purpose in referring to the centuries-old belief about wine's healthful effects, let's analyze the context:
1. The author states that most scientists assume wine is like other alcoholic beverages, with alcohol as the only active ingredient. Due to this assumption, they rarely study wine's distinct effects.
2. Despite this assumption, wine has been thought for centuries to have healthful effects that these scientists have obscured.
3. Recently, a small group of researchers questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption.
The author then goes on to discuss the findings of these researchers, which suggest that moderate wine consumption may have healthful effects.
Given this context, the most likely reason for mentioning the centuries-old belief is to suggest that the prevailing scientific assumption (that wine is no different from other alcoholic beverages) might be mistaken. The author is setting up a contrast between the traditional belief and the scientific assumption to introduce the idea that the assumption may be incorrect.

B) Passage A states fingerprint identification has an ""exceedingly low error rate"" based on the trial court's assessment. Passage B argues the error rate is unknown and cites a study showing a 34% error rate. This seems to be a clear disagreement between the passages. 
C) Neither passage argues fingerprint evidence should be considered scientific law. Passage A acknowledges it hasn't attained that status, while Passage B focuses more on its shortcomings than elevating its status. Unlikely to be a disagreement.
D) The passages don't deeply discuss the relative merits of point-counting vs. holistic methods. Passage B notes both are used, but doesn't argue for one over the other. Not enough information to determine disagreement.
E) Both passages acknowledge agencies have varying standards for declaring a match. Passage A says this is acceptable as long as a consistent approach is used, while Passage B sees it as problematic. Some disagreement, but not as clear as B.

","To determine which choice would most strengthen the passage's position about the apparently healthful effects of moderate wine consumption, let's consider the main points made in the passage:
1. Wine consumption leads to slower absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream compared to distilled spirits.
2. Moderate wine consumption is associated with decreased deaths due to premature heart disease.
3. Wine consumption is linked to increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound, decreased thickness of blood vessel walls, and reduced platelet adhesiveness.
4. A study showed decreased platelet adhesiveness in individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice, suggesting that the healthful effects of wine may come from natural compounds found in grapes.
Now, let's evaluate each choice:
A: If subjects who consumed large amounts of grape juice exhibited decreased thickness of blood vessel walls, it would support the idea that compounds in grapes, not just alcohol, contribute to the healthful effects of wine. This strengthens the passage's position.
B: Similar lipid levels in habitual wine and beer drinkers do not provide evidence for the unique healthful effects of wine. This does not strengthen the passage's position.
C: Increased platelet adhesiveness from grape juice consumption would contradict the passage's suggestion that compounds in grapes may reduce platelet adhesiveness and contribute to wine's healthful effects. This weakens the passage's position.
D: The rate of premature heart disease in excessive wine drinkers compared to moderate wine drinkers does not provide evidence for the specific healthful effects of moderate wine consumption. This does not strengthen the passage's position.

  D: The structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional stYle involves more than simply the technique of shifting between first-person and third-person narrators.
  E: Morrison disguises the important struetural connections between her narrative and Duke Ellington's jazz compositions by making the transitions between first- and third-person narrators appear easy.
","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the key points from the passage:
1. Morrison's novel Jazz draws upon a musical genre (jazz) as its structuring principle.
2. The narration shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person perspectives of key characters.
3. The narrator maintains control over the narrative while allowing characters to speak, similar to a jazz band intertwining ensemble sound with individual solos.
4. Duke Ellington constructed compositions with his musicians' unique ""voices"" in mind, but their solos always performed within the composer's frame.
5. Morrison creates an ensemble of characters improvising within a carefully constructed collective narration, simulating Ellington's style.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) The passage doesn't compare Morrison's success to other 20th-century North American writers.
B) The passage focuses on narrative techniques, not the representation of the jazz musicians' milieu.
C) The passage suggests individual characters' voices are distinct, not merging like in ensemble jazz.
E) The passage states the transitions appear easy, not disguised.
D) This choice aligns with the passage's main point - the structural analogy involves more than just shifting narrators, but also how the characters' voices are embedded within the narrator's control, similar to Ellington's compositions.

","To determine which choice best illustrates increasing returns to scale, I'll analyze each option:
A) This doesn't show increasing returns from larger scale, but rather from lowering standards. It's not a good example.
B) The bee colony illustrates the concept well. As the colony grows larger, it can specialize some bees as guards, allowing more efficient nectar collection. This efficiency enables further growth, showing increasing returns to scale.
C) The school example shows serving more students, but not increasing efficiency from larger scale. It's not the best illustration of the concept.
D) The lobster industry as a whole catches more, but not because any individual operation becomes more efficient at larger scale. This doesn't demonstrate increasing returns to scale.
E) The ant colony divides into multiple colonies that end up larger in total than a single colony could be. However, this doesn't clearly show the colonies becoming more efficient as they grow. It's not the clearest example of increasing returns.
The bee colony in B is the best illustration of increasing returns to scale. The larger colony becomes more efficient through specialization, enabling further growth.

3. He rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
4. His work displayed an impulse toward realism and depicted contemporary life.
5. Lichtenstein's work exuded a deliberate naivete and nostalgia, giving it an inner sweetness.

A. A realistic painting of simple objects doesn't capture the comic book style or the themes Lichtenstein explored.
B. Stick figures are too simplistic and don't reflect Lichtenstein's more nuanced approach to parody.
C. Bold lines and primary colors were part of Lichtenstein's style, but conveying inner turmoil was not his focus.
D. Vague shapes and images are not in line with Lichtenstein's impulse toward realism and depicting contemporary life.
E. Depicting products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values aligns with Lichtenstein's use of popular imagery, his focus on contemporary life, and his subtle social commentary through a seemingly naive style.

","To determine the function of the third paragraph, let's analyze the main points of the passage:
1. The first paragraph discusses how scholars have focused on written autobiographies of Native Americans that were influenced by non-Native collaborators, overlooking traditional modes of communicating personal history.
2. The second paragraph explains how the concept of self and autobiography in pre-contact Native American cultures differed from European notions, being more inclusive, relational, and oriented toward current events.
3. The third paragraph provides specific examples of how personal histories were expressed in pre-contact Native American cultures, such as through songs, chants, stories, names, dance, drama, tattoos, decorated shields, robes, and painted tepees.
4. The fourth paragraph discusses how Native American autobiographical expressions were shaped by cultural perspectives and the intended audience.
The third paragraph directly supports the argument presented in the second paragraph by providing concrete examples of the various modes of autobiographical expression in pre-contact Native American cultures.

  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that ""Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs."" This suggests that proverb usage depends on the individual and social context.
2. However, the passage then says ""Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts."" This directly supports the idea that proverb usage is influenced by the community.
3. Choice A is incorrect because the passage suggests proverbs are often used to reinforce community norms, especially in instructing youth.
4. While the passage does mention that proverbs are used to regulate peer-group relationships, it doesn't say this is the most frequent use, so Choice C is not the best answer.
5. The passage mentions proverbs transmitting language but doesn't say they are often used to teach languages, so Choice D is not well supported.

","To determine which statement the author would most likely agree with, let's analyze the key points made in the passage:
1. Digital publishing eliminates costs associated with physical inventory, warehousing, shipping, and displaying books. This makes digital publishing less expensive than traditional publishing.
2. The economic efficiency and convenience of the digital publishing model will likely lead it to supplant or rival traditional publishing.
3. Under the digital publishing model, authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds since many traditional publishing expenses are eliminated.
4. Literary agents will demand higher royalties for their authors from digital publishers, putting pressure on traditional publishers to reduce redundant functions or lose authors.
Considering these points, the author would most likely agree with choice B:
The ease of keeping books ""in print"" will be the primary factor in the eventual acceptance of the new digital model.
The passage emphasizes that digital publishing allows for a ""practically limitless digital catalog"" where even out-of-print books can be easily printed on demand. This ease of keeping books available, combined with the economic efficiency of digital publishing, is presented as a key driver for the eventual acceptance of the digital model.

- Points out the unknown probability of different individuals sharing identifying characteristics
- Highlights the uncertainty around error rates, especially with partial/smudged prints
- Questions how definitively examiners can evaluate fingerprint evidence
- Cites a rigorous test showing a 34% erroneous identification rate
- Tone is skeptical and critical of the reliability of fingerprint evidence
Passage B is more critical and skeptical compared to Passage A's confidence. It focuses on the lack of standards, unknown probabilities, and potential for errors.
Passage B is not more general in focus, tentative in its claims, respectful of opposing claims, or dependent on unsubstantiated assumptions compared to Passage A. Its claims are specific, assertive, critical of the opposing view, and cite some evidence.

Lines 7-11: ""They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court.""
The sentence in lines 28-31 presents a specific scenario where the lawyer believes the client may be innocent, and in that case, the lawyer should try to prove the client's innocence. This aligns with the general idea presented in lines 7-11 that lawyers should represent the defendant and not judge their guilt or innocence.
However, the sentence in lines 28-31 is more specific, focusing on cases where the lawyer believes the client may be innocent. It doesn't fully agree with the broader statement in lines 7-11, which suggests lawyers should always represent the defendant regardless of their belief in the client's innocence.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The utility maximization principle states that a rational individual will choose the action that maximizes their expected utility, considering the likelihood and utility of each possible outcome.
2. We need to find the option that is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
3. Option A: The waiter is making a calculated decision based on the low likelihood of detection and penalty. This seems rational according to the utility maximization principle.
4. Option B: The motorist is responding to the high likelihood of a costly penalty (losing her license). This also seems rational.
5. Option C: The industrialist is comparing the cost of compliance with the cost of the fine and choosing the less costly option. Again, this is a rational economic calculation.
6. Option D: The government official is weighing the potential benefit (supplementing her inadequate salary) against the risk of prosecution. While unethical, it is still a rational economic decision.
7. Option E: The worker's assault seems to be driven by emotion (feeling the dismissal was unfair) rather than a rational weighing of economic incentives and disincentives. This impulsive crime of passion seems the least rational from an economic perspective.
Therefore, option E seems to be the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

","To determine the role of the author of Passage A, let's analyze the key points:
1. The passage discusses an appeal of a criminal conviction, where the defendant is challenging the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial.
2. The author states that while further testing and development of standards for fingerprint identification may be desirable, the court sees no reason to reject this form of evidence outright.
3. The author concludes that the trial court was within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has a low error rate.
Considering these points, the author appears to be affirming the use of fingerprint evidence and the decision of the trial court. This perspective aligns with that of a judge presiding over an appeal, as they would be responsible for evaluating the arguments and making a ruling.
The author is unlikely to be a defense attorney (B), as they are not arguing in favor of the defendant's position. Similarly, the author is not a prosecutor (C), as they are not directly arguing for the affirmation of the guilty verdict, but rather evaluating the evidence and the trial court's decision.
The passage does not suggest that the author is a professor (D) or an academic (E), as the context is clearly that of a legal appeal.

According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves.""
The key points are:
1. Lawyers should state facts that assist the client's case
2. Lawyers should construct sound arguments based on these facts
3. Lawyers should identify flaws in the opposing counsel's arguments
4. Lawyers should act as advocates, not express personal opinions
5. Lawyers should say what defendants would say if they could represent themselves
This aligns best with choice C: ""a diligent representative of the client's position"".

","To determine the purpose of the reference to railroads, let's analyze the relevant part of the passage:
""Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads.""
The passage suggests that railroads are an example of an industry characterized by increasing returns to scale (the Pin Factory concept). Despite this, economists struggled to incorporate the concept of increasing returns into mainstream economic thought because it was difficult to represent mathematically.
Thought process:
A) The railroad example does not resolve any ambiguity in the Invisible Hand metaphor.
B) The railroad example illustrates an industry with increasing returns, which economists found difficult to model mathematically. This supports the idea that the Pin Factory concept was hard to state with mathematical rigor.
C) The railroad example is used to show that increasing returns were obvious in many industries, but this is not the main point of the reference.
D) The passage does not suggest that the railroad example illustrates shortcomings of the Invisible Hand concept.
E) The passage does not discuss competition levels in the railroad industry.

  E: A corrido without a surviving despedida would
","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the relevant information from the passage:
1. Corridos rely heavily on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
2. Metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when used, they incorporate everyday images familiar to the listeners.
3. Corridos are composed of familiar images and certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, most evident in the formal closing verse (despedida).
4. The despedida is the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity.
Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:
A. The passage does not suggest that ready-made lines hindered the use of metaphor. In fact, it states that metaphors are rare in corridos.
B. While corridos use familiar language, the passage does not compare this to other ballad forms.
C. The passage mentions that corridos have roots in 18th-century Spain but does not state that the imagery is the same.
D. The passage does not discuss the reportorial capability of corridos or compare them to rhymed ballad forms.

This suggests that Native Americans and Europeans had different ideas about these concepts, which are fundamental to the meaning of autobiography.

A: The passage does not discuss any relationship between the diversity of secondary substances and the number of interacting insects. It's not supported.
B: The passage suggests many plants have benefited from interactions with insects, either through pollination or developing defenses. It also indicates insects often harm plants or affect their survival. This choice contradicts the passage.
C: The passage does not discuss changes in the number of plant species within families or the number of plant families over time. There's no information to support this.
D: The passage states that secondary substances first appeared due to genetic mutations, and natural selection favored some that provided defenses against insects. This suggests insects influenced which secondary substances became prevalent in plant species, but the substances did not appear as a direct response. This choice aligns with the passage.
E: The passage mentions insects evolve ways to ""circumvent"" plants' defenses, such as detoxifying harmful substances or avoiding their effects, but it doesn't specify that no insect has developed outright immunity. There's not enough information to support this definitive statement.

3. The author notes that similar storm imagery is found in other corridos, reflecting and strengthening the continuity of the corrido tradition.
The discussion of metaphor serves to illustrate that even when metaphors are used in corridos, they are simple, familiar, and conventional. This supports the author's main point in the paragraph that corridos tell their stories ""simply and swiftly, without embellishments.""
Therefore, the primary reason for discussing metaphor is to elaborate on the claim about the directness of the language used in corridos.

","To determine Dostoyevsky's attitude, let's consider his views on the radical critics' perspective:
1. Dostoyevsky believed there was no distinction between fantasy and reality, and reality was more than just the tangible. The radical critics' demand to depict reality ""as it is"" was meaningless to him.
2. He strongly opposed the radical critics' view that art must serve a particular political view, seeing it as assigning a ""shameful destiny"" to art. 
3. Dostoyevsky believed that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals, and the formal aspects were crucial, contrary to the radical critics' utilitarian claim.
4. He found the radical critics' requirement that art must be ""useful"" unsatisfactory, as the usefulness of a work may not be immediately apparent.
Considering these points, Dostoyevsky would likely be most softened towards the radical critics if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. This aligns with his strong belief in the importance of the artistic aspects of a work.

2. Toni Morrison's novel Jazz (1992) is the first to use a musical genre (jazz) as its structuring principle.
3. The narration in Jazz shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person perspectives of characters, while the narrator maintains control over the narrative.
4. This narrative structure is analogous to a jazz band's performance, intertwining ensemble sound with individual solo performances.
5. Duke Ellington was the first to compose with individual musicians' unique ""voices"" in mind, while keeping their improvisations within the composer's frame.
6. Morrison achieves a similar effect in Jazz, creating an ensemble of characters improvising within a carefully constructed collective narration.
7. By simulating Ellington's style and exhibiting her own linguistic virtuosity, Morrison redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view in Jazz.
The main point seems to be that Morrison has created an original and effective narrative strategy in Jazz that is analogous to Duke Ellington's style of musical composition. This is best captured by choice E.

  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.
","To determine the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success, let's analyze the relevant parts of the passage:
1. The first paragraph introduces the main idea that despite profits from technological developments accruing to a few, these developments have served as a democratizing force, narrowing the gap in benefits to different groups over time.
2. The second paragraph provides examples of this democratizing effect, such as the printing press making literacy widely accessible and computers giving students access to computing power previously limited to top labs.
3. The third paragraph states that this gradual diffusion of benefits is a general tendency of the market system. It then introduces the idea that entrepreneurs and investors often need to expand their market to maximize financial success, which involves making their technologies accessible to a larger share of the population.
4. The final sentence ties this back to the main idea, stating that market competition drives prices down, diffusing access to new technology across society.
The reference to maximizing financial success is part of the causal explanation of how the market system leads to the democratizing effect of technology. It reinforces the main thesis by showing the mechanism through which this occurs.

","To determine the primary concern of the author, let's analyze the key points in the passage:
1. The author points out that most scientists have assumed wine's effects are the same as other alcoholic beverages, focusing only on the effects of alcohol.
2. However, the author highlights that a small group of researchers have recently questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption specifically.
3. The author then presents the findings of these researchers, which suggest that moderate wine consumption may have certain health benefits, such as reducing the risk of premature heart disease.
4. The author explains the potential mechanisms behind these health benefits, such as the presence of compounds in wine that may prevent damage from high lipid levels and reduce platelet adhesiveness.
Considering these points, the author's primary concern appears to be correcting the misconception that wine's effects are the same as other alcoholic beverages by presenting evidence from recent research that suggests moderate wine consumption may have distinct health benefits.

  E: Critics of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding claim these proposals are not value neutral and are therefore unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system.
","To determine the main point, let's break down the key ideas in the passage:
1. The first proposal for multicultural education advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority liberal culture. Critics argue this distorts the understanding of cultures with different values.
2. The second proposal adopts a neutral stance regarding cultural value differences but still uses Western scientific methods to study cultures. Critics argue these methods are value-laden and express Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. 
3. Critics argue that real understanding of non-scientific cultures can only be achieved by adopting their own, often non-scientific, perspectives and methods.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is incorrect as both proposals share the same goal of promoting multicultural understanding, just through different means.
B) Incorrect. Neither proposal claims education should be founded on subjective, intuitive, or mystical epistemology. 
C) Incorrect. The critics, not the proponents, argue it's not enough to refrain from judging if Western methods are used.
D) The critics' views on how values relate to circumstances are not the main focus.
E) Correct. The main point is that critics argue both proposals fail to be value-neutral due to their reliance on the majority culture's liberal values (1st proposal) or Western scientific methods (2nd proposal), preventing genuine understanding of other cultures.

1. Before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
2. Meitner recognized that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, coining the term ""nuclear fission.""
3. When scientists rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Considering the choices:
A. Meitner's insight was not directly dependent on the calculations of the theoretical physicists.
B. The passage does not discuss the acceptability of theoretical physics abroad.
C. Meitner's insight did not prove that nuclei were generally unstable, only that uranium could be split.

  E: Most early human behaviors that significantly hindered reproductive success were eliminated by evolutionary competition.
","To determine which assumption the author of passage B would consider mistaken, let's analyze their key arguments:
1. Evolutionary psychology is like a conspiracy theory, attributing hidden motives (gene propagation) to behaviors.
2. Many interests could potentially explain a given behavior. To prove a specific interest is the cause, one must show the behavior is only reasonable if driven by that interest.
3. Not all motives can be instrumental - we must care about some things for their own sake, not just as means to an end.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) The author doesn't discuss physical features, so this is unlikely to be considered a mistaken assumption.
B) The author would likely disagree with this. They argue not all behaviors are orchestrated by genes for their own propagation.
C) This aligns with the author's criticism. They argue that just showing a behavior improves reproductive success is not sufficient to prove it evolved for that reason, since other interests could also explain it.
D) The author doesn't distinguish between human and animal behavior or discuss instinct. This is unlikely to be the key mistaken assumption.
E) The author doesn't discuss the elimination of reproductively harmful behaviors. This is not central to their argument.

","To determine the author's primary purpose, let's analyze the main points of the passage:
1. The author discusses the relationship between music and literature, particularly in the African American tradition.
2. The author focuses on Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which uses a musical genre (jazz) as a structuring principle.
3. The author explains how the narration in Jazz shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism, similar to the interplay between ensemble and solo performances in jazz music.
4. The author compares Morrison's narrative structure to Duke Ellington's compositions, which were constructed with individual musicians' unique ""voices"" in mind.
5. The author concludes that Morrison has created a novel that simulates the style of a musical genius while exhibiting her own linguistic virtuosity, redefining the possibilities of narrative point of view.
Considering these points, the author's primary purpose seems to be to analyze a particular aspect (the narrative structure) of one work (Jazz) by a particular writer (Toni Morrison), and how it relates to the structure of jazz music.

  E: display the way in which intellectual arrogance sometimes hinders scientific progress
","To determine the author's primary aim, let's analyze the key points in the passage:
1. The author states that scientific understanding doesn't always progress smoothly or directly in response to data, and crucial hypotheses may be overlooked until a major revision of theory occurs.
2. The author uses the discovery of nuclear fission as an example, where evidence was compiled without recognizing what was being witnessed until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
3. The author notes that scientists were not receptive to the possibility of breaking atoms apart in the context of the neutron-bombardment experiments, despite some theoretical calculations indicating it should be possible.
4. The author emphasizes that the relevant evidence for nuclear fission had been present for some time, but lacked the right conceptual link until Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
Considering these points, the author's primary aim seems to be illustrating the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress. The passage focuses on how the discovery of nuclear fission did not occur in a straightforward manner, with crucial evidence being overlooked until a major theoretical breakthrough was made.

""Most of what has been written about Thurgood Marshall, a former United States Supreme Court justice who served from 1967 to 1991, has just focused on his judicial record and on the ideological content of his earlier achievements as a lawyer pursuing civil rights issues in the courts.""
The sentence:
1. Identifies that most writing about Marshall has focused on two aspects of his career: his judicial record and the ideological content of his earlier civil rights work as a lawyer.
2. Suggests that this focus has been limited or incomplete, as indicated by the word ""just"".
Looking at the answer choices:
A. The sentence does not dispute a claim or summarize Marshall's achievements.
B. While the sentence introduces the main topic (Marshall's career), it does not indicate the controversial nature of his ideologies.
C. The sentence introduces two aspects of Marshall's career but does not outline their historical significance.
D. This choice accurately captures the two main functions: identifying Marshall's better-known achievements (judicial record and ideological content of earlier work) and suggesting that commentary has neglected certain other achievements.
E. While the sentence provides a new perspective, it does not correct a historical inaccuracy.

","To answer this question, let's analyze the purpose of the discussion of primary substances in the passage:
1. The author introduces primary substances as one of two broad categories of chemical substances in plants, the other being secondary substances.
2. Primary substances are described as being required for growth and proper functioning, and are found in all plants. This contrasts with secondary substances, which have no known role in growth or metabolism.
3. The rest of the passage focuses on secondary substances, their diversity, and their role in plant-insect interactions and evolution.

","Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The passage begins by explaining the theory that communication between neurons happens chemically rather than electrically, via neurotransmitters. 
2. It then describes an obstacle to the theory's general acceptance: scientists had trouble understanding how the binding of a neurotransmitter could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane.
3. Next, the passage presents an explanation that helps the theory overcome this obstacle: evidence shows that neurotransmitter receptors contain both a binding site and an ion channel, and binding causes the receptor to change shape and open the ion channel.
4. Finally, the passage discusses a further implication of the theory: the discovery of receptor varieties raises the possibility of highly selective treatment of brain disorders.

A: The passage states that an excited neuron secretes a neurotransmitter chemical that binds to a receptor on the receiving neuron. This affirms that chemical secretion plays a role in neuron communication.
B: The passage says that when ions move into the receiving neuron after the neurotransmitter binds, they generate an electrical impulse. This affirms that ion flow plays a role.
C: The passage clearly states that neurotransmitters binding to receptors renders the receiving neuron permeable to ions, allowing neuron communication. This is affirmed.
D: The passage says receptor structure plays the ""pivotal role"" in converting chemical signals to electrical activity by changing shape when the neurotransmitter binds, opening an ion channel. This affirms receptor structure's role.
E: While the passage discusses neurotransmitter binding sites on receptors, it does not mention anything about the size of these sites playing a role in neuron communication.

  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
","To determine which factor would have most likely reduced the time it took for physicists to realize atoms were being split, let's analyze each choice:
A) Using the same research techniques would not necessarily lead to faster recognition of nuclear fission. Diverse techniques could potentially provide more insights.
B) If physicists did not have expectations about the nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more open to interpreting the results as nuclear fission. Having preconceived notions about the composition likely delayed the realization.
C) Being unaware of calculations showing atoms could theoretically be split likely delayed the recognition of nuclear fission. If physicists knew splitting atoms was theoretically possible, they may have considered that explanation for their experimental results sooner.
D) Having more physicists conducting experiments would generate more data, but not necessarily lead to the crucial insight about nuclear fission sooner. The key was correctly interpreting the results, not just obtaining more results.
E) Experimenting with substances other than uranium would not have helped, as uranium was the element that ended up being split in the actual experiments that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Considering these factors, choice B seems most likely to have reduced the time to realization. If the physicists did not have particular expectations about the composition of the by-products, they would have been more open to alternative explanations like nuclear fission when they observed surprising results.

1. The passage discusses Thurgood Marshall's career, focusing on his innovative strategies in public interest law while working with the NAACP.
2. It mentions that most of what has been written about Marshall focuses on his judicial record and the ideological content of his earlier achievements, rather than the technical perspective of his work.
3. The passage does not make any comparisons between the value placed on his innovations in litigation strategy versus his accomplishments on the Supreme Court. Therefore, choice A is not supported by the passage.
4. While the passage mentions that using sociological and psychological statistics in court cases was sometimes criticized, it does not state that this was the most controversial or most successful part of Marshall's campaign. Thus, choice B is not supported.
5. The passage does not discuss the use of sociological evidence by lawyers representing private interests, so choice C cannot be inferred.
6. The passage states that since Marshall's work with the NAACP, the number of public interest law firms has grown substantially, not that they were established in response to his successes. Additionally, it does not mention that these firms represented a radical change from previous types of U.S. law firms. Therefore, choice D is not supported.

  D: having unsold books returned to publishers
  E: displaying books in retail stores
","To determine which option is NOT identified as something digital publishing will eliminate the need for, I'll check if each choice is mentioned in the passage as being made unnecessary by digital publishing.
A: The passage states ""the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing"". So warehousing printed books is identified as unnecessary with digital publishing.
B: The passage does not mention anything about book cover design being eliminated by digital publishing.
C: The passage states digital publishing eliminates ""shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores"". So this is identified as unnecessary.
D: The passage states digital publishing eliminates ""returning unsold books to publishers"". So this is identified as unnecessary.
E: The passage states digital publishing eliminates ""displaying pbysieal books in retail stores"". So this is identified as unnecessary.
The only option not mentioned as being eliminated by digital publishing is B, having book covers designed.

  C: outline the intuitions supporting a particular economic assumption
  D: describe the tensions resulting from attempts to model two competing economic assumptions
  E: refute an argument against a particular economic assumption
","To determine the main purpose of the fourth paragraph, let's analyze it step-by-step:
1. The paragraph begins by stating that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, while the Pin Factory (representing increasing returns) was de-emphasized.
2. It then asks why this was the case and clarifies that it wasn't due to ideology but rather the ease of mathematical representation. Economists sought rigor and clarity through numbers and equations.
3. The paragraph explains that diminishing returns lend themselves to elegant formalism, while increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically.
4. It mentions that many economists tried to bring the Pin Factory (increasing returns) into the mainstream of economic thought, as it characterized many enterprises like railroads. However, they failed because they couldn't state their ideas with sufficient rigor.
Considering these points, the main purpose of the fourth paragraph is to explain the difficulty associated with modeling the economic assumption of increasing returns (the Pin Factory), which prevented it from being incorporated into mainstream economic thought for a long time.

  D: There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers.
  E: The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly.
","To determine the most likely outcome, let's consider each choice:
A) If books are printed on demand, there would still be a need to warehouse paper and binding materials, rather than individual books. This seems plausible.
B) The passage doesn't discuss used books. It's focused on the printing of new books on demand. There's not enough information to conclude patronage of used bookstores would increase significantly.
C) The passage suggests upstart digital publishing firms would bid for manuscripts first, not that most publishers would sell books individually without distributors or retailers. 
D) While digital publishing would reduce certain costs, the passage doesn't indicate less demand for copy editors or book designers. Manuscripts would still need to be edited and book layouts designed.
E) If books are printed on demand from digital files, the overall demand for book-grade paper may not necessarily decrease, as copies are still being printed, just at the point of sale.
Considering the information provided, choice A seems most likely. Printing on demand would shift warehousing needs from storing individual books to storing the paper and materials needed to print and bind books at the point of sale.

  E: use of the holistic approach to fingerprint identification
","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the key points from each passage:
Passage A:
- Discusses the defendant's challenge to fingerprint evidence reliability
- Mentions lack of uniform, objective standards among fingerprint examiners
- States that while different agencies may require different degrees of correlation, examiners are held to a consistent ""points and characteristics"" approach
Passage B: 
- Discusses the lack of objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches
- Mentions variations in local practices, such as point-counting vs. holistic approaches
- Highlights the unknown probability of two individuals sharing identifying characteristics
- Questions the error rate in actual practice
Both passages discuss the reliability of fingerprint identification in relation to the differences in identification practices used by various fingerprint examiners (choice C). 
Passage A acknowledges these differences but argues that examiners still follow a consistent approach overall. Passage B emphasizes these differences as a weakness in the reliability of the practice.
The other choices are mentioned in the passages but are not the main point of discussion in relation to reliability in both passages.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Passage A presents an evolutionary psychology explanation for altruistic behavior, arguing that apparently unselfish actions can arise from ""selfish"" genes promoting their own propagation.
2. Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology explanations. It compares them to conspiracy theories, where a hidden motive (gene propagation) is imputed to explain behavior.
3. The author of Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology explanations are often not decisive, because there could be multiple interests or motives that explain a given behavior. Just because gene propagation could explain altruism doesn't mean it's the only or best explanation.
4. By arguing that evolutionary psychology explanations rely on imputing hidden motives and that their reasoning is often not decisive, the author of Passage B is suggesting that the type of argument made in Passage A relies on questionable reasoning.
5. The other choices don't fit as well. The author of Passage B is not supporting Passage A's claims, not focusing on inaccurate observations, and not saying the claims are vacuous or unfalsifiable. The main thrust is questioning the reasoning.

B: Ending rehabilitation efforts would decrease the expected utility of lawful activities for criminals, making them more likely to return to crime. The author would likely agree.
C: Decreasing the expected utility of lawful activities would make deliberate crimes relatively more attractive. This goes against the author's argument that increasing the utility of lawful activities helps deter crime. The author would likely disagree with this statement.
D: Decreasing access to economic institutions would lower the expected utility of lawful activities, making deliberate crimes more attractive. The author would likely agree.
E: Stronger law enforcement increases the likelihood of detection and punishment, lowering the expected utility of crime. This would reduce the crime rate, so the author would likely agree.

  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
","To determine the meaning of ""bicultural composite authorship"", let's analyze the context in which it is used:
The passage states that most scholars have focused on ""as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from 'bicultural composite authorship.'""
This suggests that ""bicultural composite authorship"" involves:
1. A Native American person providing their life history orally
2. A non-Native American person soliciting, translating, recording, and editing this oral history into a written form
The key aspects are:
- Two people from different cultures are involved 
- The Native American provides the content orally
- The non-Native American puts it into written form through editing and translation
Looking at the answer choices, option E best captures these key elements:
""written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture""
Therefore, E is the most accurate description of ""bicultural composite authorship"" as used in the passage.

  E: A decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe.
","To determine which choice is most consistent with the ideas about identity in pre-contact Native American cultures, let's review the relevant information from the passage:
- In pre-contact Native American cultures, identity was not merely individual, but also relational to society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos.
- Autobiographical expressions included taking on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life.
- A tepee painted with symbolic designs could record the achievements and dreams or visions of its owner.
Considering each choice:
A) The passage doesn't discuss what happens when a person is raised by a different tribe.
B) This aligns with the idea that identity was relational to the cosmos. Incorporating a constellation symbol suggests a connection between the individual and the cosmos.
C) The passage doesn't compare naming rituals across communities.
D) The passage doesn't discuss whether names could be shared within a community.
E) The passage states that a decorated shield could communicate the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, suggesting it could be traced to an individual, not necessarily a particular tribe.
The choice most consistent with the passage is B, as it reflects the idea that identity was relational to the cosmos.
