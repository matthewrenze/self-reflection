  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","  Answer: C

According to the passage, proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph argue that real understanding of non-Western cultures can only be achieved by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would be considered objectionable by these proponents, as it would be seen as imposing Western values and methods onto a culture that does not share those values.

The other options do not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures and therefore would not be considered objectionable by proponents of this version of multicultural education:

A: A study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a comparative study that aims to understand the differences between various moral codes.

B: A study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a study of the culture's own values and beliefs.

D: A study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a study that aims to understand and critique the literature of a particular society using the values and beliefs of that society.

  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
","  The answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

In passage B, the author describes evolutionary psychology as a ""conspiracy theory"" because it attributes an interest in the propagation of genes to individuals without their conscious awareness or acknowledgment. The author argues that this kind of inference needs to be handled with care, as there are often many interests that could explain a particular behavior, and it is not always clear that a particular interest is the decisive factor.

In passage A, option D is the most clear example of this kind of inference. The author suggests that genes may promote their own propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child. This implies that the mother's behavior is not solely motivated by her own interests or desires, but is also influenced by an interest in promoting the survival and replication of her genes. This is an example of the kind of ""conspiracy"" that the author of passage B is referring to, as it attributes an interest in gene propagation to the mother's behavior without her conscious awareness or acknowledgment.

The other options do not clearly exemplify this aspect of evolutionary psychology. Option A is a general statement about the approach of evolutionary psychology, which does not necessarily imply a ""conspiracy theory."" Option B is a statement about the difficulty of explaining altruism from an evolutionary perspective, which does not necessarily involve attributing hidden motives to individuals.

  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
","  Answer: D

The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly, as larger businesses can achieve lower costs and drive smaller firms out of business. However, if the size that a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, then it's not necessarily the case that larger businesses will dominate smaller ones in every industry.

In other words, if there are industries where smaller businesses can achieve the same or similar economies of scale as larger ones, then the connection between increased size and monopoly power is weakened. This is because smaller businesses in those industries would still be able to compete effectively with larger ones, even if they have smaller production volumes.

Therefore, option D undermines the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that size alone is not a determining factor in achieving dominance in a particular industry.",,,E,0,1105,211,1316,

  E: An evolutionary explanation of altruistic behavior may lie in the psychological states brought about in early humans by cues of kinship or familiarity.
","  Answer: E

Explanation:
Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology can account for altruistic behavior, which seems to be problematic for a theory that emphasizes individual reproductive success. The passage suggests that altruistic behavior can be understood as a result of psychological experiences of identification and empathy, which were initially aroused by cues of kinship or familiarity and increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance. This would enhance the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy, thereby promoting the propagation of genetic material. Therefore, option E accurately states the main point of passage A.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that altruistic behavior diminishes the reproductive success of individuals that exhibit it. Instead, it explains how altruistic behavior can be understood as serving evolutionary purposes.

Option B is incorrect because while the passage mentions new evidence that may explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, it does not state that this evidence shows that genes promote their own self-propagation.

Option C is incorrect because while the passage mentions that humans no longer live in small, kin-based groups, it does not suggest that altruistic behavior originally served evolutionary purposes that it does not serve today.

Option D is incorrect because while the passage mentions that critics of evolutionary psychology argue that most significant types of human behavior are not prompted by genetically selfish motivations, it does not take a position on this issue.

It also states, ""Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms."" Additionally, it states, ""Still, other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful.""

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not mention recent natural mutations in plants.

Option C is incorrect because the passage does not mention any chemical reactions between secondary substances in plants and substances produced by insects.

Option D is incorrect because the passage states that only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family.

Option E is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about secondary substances acting as regulators of plants' growth or metabolism.",,,A,0,1029,319,1348,

  D: pleased that it does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers
  E: convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers
","  Answer: A

The author's attitude toward the twofold obligation introduced in lines 20-23 is best described as confident that it enables defense lawyers to balance their competing responsibilities to the court and to society. The author argues that defense lawyers have an obligation to both their clients and the court, and that this twofold obligation allows them to balance these responsibilities. The author believes that by following this approach, defense lawyers can provide the best defense possible while also upholding their duty to the court and society. Therefore, option A is the best answer.

Option B is incorrect because the author does not suggest that the twofold obligation prevents defense lawyers from representing clients whom they know to be guilty. Instead, the author argues that defense lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false to the court, but they should still represent their clients to the best of their ability.

Option C is also incorrect because while the author mentions that defense lawyers should uncover the relevant facts of a case, this is not the main focus of the passage. The author's primary concern is the balance between the defense lawyer's obligation to their client and their obligation to the court and society.

Option D is incorrect because the author does not suggest that the twofold obligation does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers. In fact, the author acknowledges that defense lawyers have a duty to provide the best defense possible, but argues that this duty must be balanced with their obligation to the court and society.

Option E is incorrect because the author does not argue that the twofold obligation does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers. Instead, the author acknowledges that defense lawyers have competing responsibilities to their clients and to the court, and argues that they must balance these responsibilities in order to provide the best defense possible while also upholding their duty to the court and society.",,,E,0,1000,440,1440,

Explanation:
The author refers to ""the relevant evidence"" (line 62) as the data that scientists had been collecting, which ultimately led to the discovery of nuclear fission. The correct answer is D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus. This fact was a crucial piece of evidence that helped Meitner recognize the significance of the data and conclude that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

Choice A is incorrect because the author is not referring to all the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, but rather the specific evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.

Choice B is incorrect because Meitner's related experiments in 1938 did not directly lead to the discovery of nuclear fission.

Explanation:
Passage A suggests that ""capricious enforcement"" refers to a situation where a law enforcement agency exercises its discretion in enforcing the law in an arbitrary or unpredictable manner, without following the intent of the legislature. Therefore, option E is the best answer.

In Passage A, the author notes that law enforcement agencies have the power to decline to prosecute violators of the law, and that this power is frequently exercised. The author also explains that laws are often overinclusive, meaning that they prohibit some conduct that the legislature did not intend to forbid. The author suggests that enforcing such laws to the letter would be overly costly and could result in punishing innocent people. Instead, the author proposes a technique called ""discretionary nonenforcement"" to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.

Therefore, option E, ""not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law,"" best captures the idea of capricious enforcement described in Passage A.",,,E,0,1104,246,1350,

The passage states that officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. This implies that the city has not been vigilant in enforcing water bill payments in the past. The passage does not provide information to support the other choices. Choice A is not necessarily true, as the passage only mentions that 231,000 water customers are late paying their bills, without specifying the proportion of customers this represents.

Passage A asserts that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability, suggesting that it should be considered a scientific law. Passage B, on the other hand, argues that there are no objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, casting doubt on its reliability and suitability for scientific law status. Therefore, the authors would likely disagree on this point.
Choices A, B, C, and E are not correct because they do not accurately reflect a point of disagreement between the two passages. Choice A is incorrect because both passages agree that uniformity in training is desirable. Choice B is incorrect because both passages acknowledge that fingerprint examiners can make mistakes, but they differ on the likelihood of such mistakes and the implications for the reliability of fingerprint identification. Choice C is incorrect because Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has been used for 100 years and is reliable, while Passage B argues that there are no objective standards for evaluation, but does not directly address the status of scientific law.

Explanation:
The passage suggests that moderate wine consumption may have healthful effects, such as decreasing the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels and reducing platelet adhesiveness. The fact that grape juice, which contains the same natural compounds as wine, also decreases platelet adhesiveness, strengthens the idea that the healthful effects of wine are due to the natural compounds present in grapes and not to the alcohol itself. Therefore, choice A, which states that subjects who consumed large amounts of grape juice exhibited decreased thickness of the innermost walls of their blood vessels, supports the passage's position concerning the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption.

Choices B, C, D, and E do not strengthen the passage's position. Choice B is irrelevant to the discussion of wine's healthful effects.

","  Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as ""literature"" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing has aspired to the condition of music, in which form contributes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as if with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.

","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
Increasing returns to scale refer to a situation where the output of a system increases at a faster rate than the input. In other words, as the size of the system increases, the output per unit of input also increases.

Option B illustrates this concept perfectly. A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar. This collected nectar can then feed a larger colony, which can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because the colony's output (nectar collected and processed) increases faster than its input (number of bees).

Option A does not illustrate increasing returns to scale. While the publishing house may be able to improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing standards, this does not necessarily lead to an increase in output per unit of input.

Option C does not illustrate increasing returns to scale. While the school district may be able to accommodate more students by switching to year-round operation, this is not an example of increasing returns to scale because the output (number of students accommodated) does not increase faster than the input (number of students).

Option D does not illustrate increasing returns to scale. While the lobster industry may be able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps due to advances in technology, this is not an example of increasing returns to scale because the output (number of lobsters caught) does not increase faster than the input (number of traps).

Option E does not illustrate increasing returns to scale. While a large ant colony may divide and produce two competing colonies that eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies, this is not an example of increasing returns to scale because the output (number of ants) does not increase faster than the input (number of colonies).",,B,B,1,1164,428,1592,

A: a painting that uses realistic techniques to represent several simple objects arranged on a table.

Lichtenstein's work is characterized by its use of comic book imagery and stylized representations of everyday objects, such as table lamps and hot dogs.

","  Answer: B

The author suggests that the ease of keeping books ""in print"" will be a significant factor in the eventual acceptance of the new digital model. The author states that digital publishing allows for the instantaneous transmission and retrieval of digital text, making it possible to print books on demand at point of sale, eliminating the costs associated with traditional publishing, and making it possible to keep a virtually limitless digital catalog of books in print. The author also notes that this will make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing, which will likely lead to its eventual acceptance.

The other options are not supported by the text. There is no mention of changing literary tastes (A), the role of literary agents (C), innovative marketing strategies (D), or widespread familiarity with new ways of storing information (E) as factors in the acceptance of the new digital model.",,,C,0,1019,194,1213,

While the author notes that economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations, the passage does not suggest that this quest is unattainable or that economics is inherently flawed.

D: The passage does not state that under the Pin Factory model, no one is in a position to exert monopoly power. In fact, the passage suggests that the natural tendency of increasing returns is toward monopoly, since a large business can achieve larger scale and lower costs than a small business.

  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.
","  Answer: B

The passage suggests that proverbs serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity within Mexican American communities, and that they are used to transmit Mexican culture and language to younger generations. The passage states that ""proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment."" It also notes that proverbs provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Therefore, option B is the best answer, as it states that the frequent use of proverbs within any community serves, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community. This is supported by the passage, which highlights the role of proverbs in transmitting Mexican culture and language to younger generations and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity within Mexican American communities.

Option A is not supported by the passage, as it suggests that the primary purpose of using proverbs to inculcate table manners is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition. While the passage does mention that proverbs can serve a didactic purpose, it does not suggest that this is their primary purpose or that it is uniquely associated with maintaining ties to an ethnic tradition.

Option C is incorrect, as the passage notes that many Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, and that they are part of a common proverb tradition of Europe. Therefore, the ways in which Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs are not necessarily typical of the ways in which Spanish speakers throughout the world use those proverbs.

Option D is also incorrect, as while the passage notes that the meaning of a proverb can vary depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which it is used, it does not suggest that some proverbs do not require a verbal context to be understood.

Finally, option E is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about the emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishing those communities from other communities within the United States.",,,D,0,1032,490,1522,

  D: The invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press.
  E: Near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies.
","  Answer: C

The author would agree with the statement that expanded access to printed texts across a population has historically led to an increase in literacy in that population. The author mentions that before the printing press was introduced, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. This suggests that the author believes that increased access to technology, in this case, printed texts, leads to a more equal distribution of resources and opportunities, which is in line with choice C.

It is not clear from the passage whether the author would agree with the other choices. Choice A, that the democratizing influence of technology generally contributes to technological obsolescence, is not supported by the passage. The author does not mention anything about technological obsolescence, and the passage suggests that technological advancements have a positive impact on society by making resources and opportunities more accessible to a wider population.

Choice B, that wholly unregulated economies are probably the fastest in producing an equalization of social status, is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While the author does mention that market competition drives prices down and tends to diffuse access to new technology across society, they do not explicitly state that unregulated economies are the fastest in producing an equalization of social status.

Choice D, that the invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press, is not supported by the passage. The author does mention that the invention of the telephone has greatly extended the power of distant communication, but they do not suggest that it has had a greater democratizing influence than the printing press.

Choice E, that near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies, is not mentioned in the passage. While the author does suggest that market competition tends to diffuse access to new technology across society, they do not explicitly state that near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies.",,,C,0,1019,524,1543,

  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
","  Answer: E

Explanation:

The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor would not be described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The utility maximization principle suggests that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected overall satisfaction or utility. However, physically assaulting someone is not likely to result in a positive outcome for the worker, as it could lead to legal consequences, harm to his reputation, and further damage to his relationships with his former employer and colleagues.

The other options can be described as rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives:

A: The waiter's decision to conceal his tip income to reduce his taxes is a rational response to the economic incentive of avoiding taxes.

B: The motorist's decision to avoid speeding is a rational response to the economic disincentive of a speeding ticket and the potential loss of her driver's license.

C: The industrialist's decision to illegally discharge the pollutant is a rational response to the economic incentive of avoiding the cost of treatment, even though it is illegal.

D: The government official's decision to risk prosecution for soliciting bribes is a rational response to the economic disincentive of a low government salary in the face of rampant inflation.

","  Based on the passage, the author would be most likely to agree with choice A: ""The diversity of secondary substances that develop in a plant population is proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history.""

The passage explains that the characteristic smell or taste of a plant is determined by its chemical composition, and that secondary substances, which are not required for the plant's growth or metabolism, give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. It also states that insects have played a major role in the development of secondary substances in plants, as some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects or serve as biochemical defenses against insects.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the diversity of secondary substances in a plant population would be proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history, as the interaction between plants and insects has driven the development of these secondary substances.

The other choices do not accurately reflect the relationship between plants and insects as described in the passage. Choice B is incorrect because, while some species of insects may use plants without harming them, many species of insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' chemical defenses, which suggests that plants have been affected by their interactions with insects. Choice C is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention any changes in the number of plant species within each family or the number of families of plants.

Choice D is partially correct in that the passage states that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, but it also explains that insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species. Therefore, while insects have not directly caused the development of specific secondary substances, they have played a role in their development and distribution.

Finally, choice E is incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about insects evolving immunity to plants' secondary substances. Instead, it states that insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' defenses, which suggests that they have developed mechanisms to avoid or detoxify the harmful effects of these substances.",,,D,0,1138,484,1622,

","  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit,"" and that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. He defined ""artistry"" as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

Option A is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy. In fact, Dostoyevsky believed that reality and fantasy were intimately bound up with each other, and that the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.

Option B is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work. Dostoyevsky believed that artistry was the ability to write well, and that a literary work must be judged on its artistic merit, regardless of its purpose.

Option C is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works. In fact, Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.

Option E is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is.

Explanation:
The reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52-54) serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development. The author argues that entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, which involves structuring their prices to consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. This explanation reinforces the thesis that technological developments have served as a democratizing force and narrowed the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

","  Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial hypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split. Between 1934, when a group of Italian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing. Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse. In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year, he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occurred, it went ""against all previous experiences of nuclear physics,"" but he also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus. It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term ""nuclear fission,"" she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

","  Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

The passage suggests that the author would likely agree with statement E, that beer and distilled spirits contain active ingredients other than alcohol whose effects tend to be beneficial. The passage states that ""One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages."" This implies that the author believes that there may be beneficial compounds in grape juice that are not present in other alcoholic beverages, and that these compounds may contribute to the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption. Therefore, the author would likely agree that beer and distilled spirits may also contain beneficial active ingredients that are not present in wine.

The other choices are not supported by the passage. There is no evidence to suggest that the author would disagree with studying the possible healthful effects of moderate consumption of beer and distilled spirits (choice A). The passage does not question the conclusion that alcohol affects lipid processing (choice B), and in fact, states that alcohol has negative physiological effects, including affecting the body's processing of lipids. The passage also does not suggest that moderate consumption of wine made from plums or apples would be unlikely to reduce the risk of premature heart disease (choice C).

","  Answer: B

Dostoyevsky believed that a work of art should be able to express the author's thoughts through characters and images in a way that the reader can fully understand. He also believed that artistry is simply the ability to write well.

Option B describes a novel that embodies these principles. The author's ideas are given substance through suitable characters and events, which suggests that the work is able to effectively convey the author's thoughts through the use of artistic expression. This option best aligns with Dostoyevsky's definition of an ""artistic"" work.

Option A may be considered artistic, but it is more focused on conveying factual information about illness rather than expressing the author's thoughts and ideas through characters and events.

Option C may also be considered artistic, but it relies more on allegory than on characters and events to communicate the author's ideas.

Option D is an autobiographical essay, which may be artistic in its own right, but it does not fit Dostoyevsky's definition of a work of art that expresses the author's thoughts through characters and events.

","  Action: Answer(""A"")

Explanation:
Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP used a strategic approach to litigation, carefully selecting cases with sympathetic litigants and using sociological and psychological statistics to transform constitutional law. They also employed a test case strategy, sponsoring litigation of tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision.

Option A most closely analogous to the strategies that Marshall utilized during his work with the NAACP. It involves pursuing a pollution case based on its potential legal implications for a large class of related cases, and using testimony by a noted medical authority whose data support the claim that the pollution in question causes widespread medical problems. This approach is similar to Marshall's test case strategy and his use of sociological and psychological statistics to transform constitutional law.

Option B, acceptance of a pollution case based on the practical urgency of its expected impact on the environment if a ruling in favor of the plaintiff is rendered, and assignment of the case to the most widely known members of the firm, does not closely resemble Marshall's strategies. While Marshall did prioritize cases with significant potential impact, he did not base his decisions solely on the practical urgency of the case.

Option C, preference for pursuing a series of cases that are to be tried in courts having a record of decisions that are favorable to environmental interests, and taking these cases to judges who strictly uphold constitutional principles, does not closely resemble Marshall's strategies either. While Marshall did consider the jurisdiction and judges when selecting cases, he did not limit his cases to only those that would be heard by favorable judges.

Option D, acceptance of a pollution damage case based primarily on the potential plaintiff's needs, and careful orchestration of pretrial publicity designed to acquaint the public with the relevant issues, does not involve the same level of strategic planning and coordination as Marshall's approach.

Option E, thorough and painstaking research of precedents relating to a current pollution case, and consultations with lawyers for the defense regarding a pretrial settlement, does not closely resemble Marshall's strategies either. While Marshall did conduct thorough research and sometimes engaged in settlement negotiations, his primary focus was on developing and executing a strategic legal campaign.",,A,A,1,1240,534,1774,

The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed a work of literature's primary goal should be to express the author's thoughts and ideas effectively, rather than serving a particular political or social purpose.

Option A is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky does discuss the importance of the fantastic in literature, he does not describe it as a key aspect of a work's ""usefulness.""

Option C is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky acknowledges that literature can have a role in shaping society, he does not see this as its primary purpose.

  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
","  Answer: B

The passage states that the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were not receptive to the possibility that atoms might be split, and that their research was hampered by their expectation that the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, option B, ""The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products,"" would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

Without preconceived notions about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, the physicists would have been more open to considering alternative explanations for the data they were collecting, including the possibility of nuclear fission. This would have allowed them to recognize the significance of the evidence more quickly and come to the conclusion that atoms were being split sooner.

The other options do not address the key issue of the physicists' expectations and preconceptions, and therefore would not have had the same impact on the amount of time it took for them to realize that atoms were being split.",,,B,0,1184,265,1449,

Explanation:
The passage suggests that Marshall's techniques have been widely adopted by public interest law firms in the U.S. and have been used for various public purposes, including consumer advocacy campaigns and politically conservative public interest lawyers seeking to achieve changes in the law. This implies that Marshall's techniques lend themselves to being used even for purposes that Marshall might not have intended, which is option E.

The other options are not supported by the passage. Option A is incorrect because while the passage suggests that Marshall's innovations in litigation strategy have been undervalued, it does not explicitly state that his accomplishments on the U.S. Supreme Court have been undervalued. Option B is also incorrect because while the passage mentions that Marshall's use of sociological and psychological statistics was controversial, it does not suggest that it was the most successful part of his overall campaign with the NAACP. Option C is incorrect because the passage does not mention whether lawyers representing private interests had previously used sociological evidence in court cases.

","  Answer: The author of passage A would be most likely to agree with choice D: A better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills.

The author of passage A discusses how law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws by declining to prosecute violators. The author also explains that rules of law are often overinclusive and that enforcing them to the letter can impose heavy social costs. The author suggests that discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the costs of overinclusion without a corresponding increase in underinclusion.

In passage B, the plan to selectively cut off water to high-income neighborhoods is described as a way to show that the city is serious about collecting overdue bills. However, the plan is criticized for being unfair and ineffective.

Given the author's views on the limitations of law enforcement and the need to reduce the costs of overinclusion, it is likely that the author would support a more targeted and efficient approach to collecting overdue water bills. Placing liens on properties owned by those who are late paying their bills, as suggested in choice D, would be a more effective and fair way to collect debts without imposing unnecessary social costs.

  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
","  Answer: E

The criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education argues that understanding other cultures requires adopting the perspectives and methods of those cultures, which Western scientific methods cannot achieve. Therefore, option E, which asserts that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education. It emphasizes the importance of understanding other cultures, which the second version of multicultural education fails to achieve by relying on Western scientific methods.

Option A is incorrect because, although it may be difficult for outsiders to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture, it is not impossible. Option B is also incorrect because the similarity of value systems among non-Western societies does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods are inadequate for understanding cultures with different values. Option C is incorrect because, although some non-Western societies may use their own value systems when studying cultures with different values, this does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods are inadequate for understanding cultures with different values.

The fourth paragraph explains how economists have struggled to reconcile the idea of increasing returns to scale (represented by the Pin Factory) with the idea of the invisible hand and competition (represented by the assumption of diminishing returns). The paragraph highlights how the Pin Factory concept suggests that larger firms can achieve lower costs and drive smaller firms out of business, leading to monopolies, which contradicts the idea of the invisible hand, which assumes many competitors in each industry.

  D: There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers.
  E: The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly.
","  Answer: E) The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly.

If the scenario described in the first two paragraphs were to become true, then the demand for book-grade paper would decrease significantly. This is because the digital publication of books would reduce the need for physical books, which would in turn reduce the need for paper.

The other options do not logically follow from the scenario described:

A) The need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books. - This option is incorrect because the scenario describes a shift from physical books to digital publications, which would reduce the need for warehousing overall, rather than shifting the need to a different type of material.

B) The patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly. - This option is incorrect because the scenario describes a shift to digital publications, which would likely reduce the demand for used books and therefore the patronage of stores that sell them.

C) Most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers. - This option is incorrect because the scenario does not describe a shift away from traditional publishing models, but rather a shift to digital publishing models that would still involve publishers, distributors, and retailers.

E: The rate of deliberate crimes will tend to vary inversely with the level of law enforcement.

The passage suggests that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is one way to deter deliberate crimes. However, the passage also suggests that increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate.

Explanation:
The author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures an inclusive view of identity that is relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. In such cultures, a person's identity is not merely individual but also communal. Therefore, option D, which states that a name given to one member of a community cannot be given to another member of the same community, is the most consistent with the author's attribution. This option highlights the importance of individual identity within the community and suggests that each person has a unique role and status within the group.

Option A is inconsistent with the author's attribution because it suggests that a person's identity can be determined by their birth tribe, even if they are brought up by members of another tribe. This implies a fixed and essentialist view of identity that is at odds with the author's description of pre-contact Native American cultures.

Option B is also inconsistent with the author's attribution because it suggests that a person's identity can be represented through a pictograph that incorporates a symbol for a constellation. While this option acknowledges the importance of the cosmos in pre-contact Native American cultures, it does not take into account the relational and communal nature of identity that the author describes.

Option C is inconsistent with the author's attribution because it suggests that a similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities. This implies a degree of homogeneity across different Native American cultures that the author does not suggest.

Option E is inconsistent with the author's attribution because it suggests that a decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe. This implies a lack of connection between an individual's identity and their community, which is at odds with the author's description of pre-contact Native American cultures.",,D,B,0,1082,417,1499,
