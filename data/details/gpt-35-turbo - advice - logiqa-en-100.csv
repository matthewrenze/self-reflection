","Thought:
The argument states that the decision to do good or bad behavior depends on the length of a person's life. If a person only has one day to live, then stealing is the best option because they won't suffer the fear of being caught. If a person has a longer life expectancy, then stealing is not the best option because they will suffer the fear of being caught. The assumption upon which the argument relies is that the fear of being caught is the primary factor that determines whether a person engages in good or bad behavior.

","Thought:
The survey shows that 63% of the respondents favored college students as nanny, but nearly 60% said ""no"" when asked if they would ask college students to be nanny. This seems contradictory. Therefore, we need to find a statement that can reasonably explain this phenomenon.
Option A talks about the type of work that college students will do as a nanny, but it does not explain why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.
Option B talks about the salary that people are willing to pay, but it does not explain why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.
Option C explains that people think doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, but it does not explain why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.
Option D talks about the belief that students should choose a field related to their major in practice, but it does not explain why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.
Therefore, Option C is the best explanation for the seemingly contradictory phenomenon because it explains why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.

Choices:
  A: ""Artificial"" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective
  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition
  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for ""customized babies"", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused

  D: ""Customized babies"" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics
","Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice B, which talks about the potential risks of technological development. However, this choice does not directly address the views of ordinary people about the possibility of ""customized babies"". After reflecting on the problem, I realized that the question is asking for the answer that would best refute the views of ordinary people. Therefore, I should look for the answer choice that directly addresses the idea of ""customized babies"". 
Thought:
The views of ordinary people are that humans may usher in the era of ""customized babies"". To refute this view, we need to find an answer choice that challenges the possibility of ""customized babies"".
