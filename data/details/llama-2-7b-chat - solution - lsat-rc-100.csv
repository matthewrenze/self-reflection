I previously answered choice (C) as the most likely objectionable option, but upon further reflection, I realize that it is actually choice (E) that is most likely to be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.

The passage highlights the problem with trying to understand non-Western cultures through the methods of Western science, which are value-laden and may not be appropriate for understanding cultures that have different values and perspectives. Choice (E) involves using the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture, which is similar to the approach of trying to understand non-Western cultures through Western scientific methods. Therefore, it is likely that proponents of multicultural education would object to this approach.

In contrast, choices (A), (B), and (D) are not necessarily objectionable, as they involve studying the differences between moral codes, literature, and literary theories, respectively, without necessarily imposing the values of Western culture.

The passage states that ""Marshall's combination of strategies for litigation, devoting them to various public purposes, has been widely adopted by public interest law firms in the U.S."" (para. 5). This suggests that Marshall's methods were not initially embraced by everyone in the NAACP, but were later adopted by other public interest law firms.

Additionally, the passage mentions that ""Marshall and the NAACP developed innovations that forever changed the landscape of public interest law"" (para. 1), which further supports the idea that Marshall's tactics were initially opposed but later became widely accepted.

Upon reviewing the passage, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (B) prompted individuals to behave unselfishly. According to passage A, the problem of altruism is a thorny one, and the answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. These experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.

After re-reading the passages and analyzing the arguments presented, I realize that the correct answer is (E) Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable.

Both passages emphasize the importance of objective standards in fingerprint identification. In Passage A, the court acknowledges that while fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has withstood the test of time. However, the court also recognizes that there are no established error rates for fingerprint identification and that examiners lack uniform, objective standards. Therefore, the court concludes that while fingerprint identification may be reliable, it is important to have objective standards in place to ensure its reliability.

Similarly, in Passage B, the author highlights the lack of objective standards for evaluating whether two prints ""match."" The author notes that different examiners use different methods for evaluating fingerprints, and that there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed for a match. The author also notes that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and that even proficiency tests may not provide a complete picture of examiners' accuracy. Therefore, the author argues that it is important to have objective standards in place to ensure the reliability of fingerprint identification.

Therefore, the principle that underlies the arguments in both passages is the importance of objective standards in fingerprint identification to ensure its reliability.

The passage explains that the traditional theory of electrical signaling in the brain is no longer tenable, as evidence suggests that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. The passage also highlights the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which are receptors that contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions. These receptors are found in various forms throughout the brain, and their subtle differences may allow for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice (A) as the main point of the passage. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is choice (B). The passage highlights how Marshall's litigation strategies, developed in pursuit of the NAACP's civil rights goals, have become standard tactics for public interest lawyers. This is the main point of the passage, as it emphasizes the innovative and lasting impact of Marshall's work on the field of public interest law.

The passage explains that Marshall and the NAACP developed a strategic and methodological legacy to the field of public interest law, including the use of test case strategies and the careful selection of cases with sympathetic litigants. These tactics have been widely adopted by other public interest law firms in the US, and have been used in a variety of contexts, including consumer advocacy campaigns and politically conservative public interest law.

While choice (A) mentions the success of Marshall's strategies in arguing against discriminatory laws, it does not emphasize the broader impact of his work on the field of public interest law. Choice (C) highlights the unexpected influence of Marshall's work on current political objectives, but does not specifically address the innovative tactics he developed. Choice (D) suggests that Marshall's tactics were previously considered a radical departure from accepted practice, but does not explain their subsequent adoption as standard conventions. Finally, choice (E) is not supported by the passage, as it suggests that Marshall's contributions to the NAACP have had more lasting impact than his work as a Supreme Court justice, which is not the main point of the passage.",,B,B,1,1322,385,1707,

I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage is more likely to have been drawn from option C: an editorial in a contemporary newspaper from the Lower Rio Grande Border.

The passage provides historical and cultural context about the corrido, a type of narrative folk song, and its origins in the Lower Rio Grande Border region. The language used is formal and informative, with a focus on the significance of the corrido in affirming the cohesiveness of Border communities. The passage also highlights the conventional elements of the corrido, such as its use of familiar images and ready-made lines, and its formal closing verse, or despedida.

In contrast, options A, B, and E do not align with the content and tone of the passage. Option B is focused on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain, which is not relevant to the passage's topic. Option A is a brochure for tourists, but the passage does not provide information that would be useful for tourists. Option E is a book describing various North American folk song forms, but the passage specifically focuses on the corrido and its unique features.

Initial Answer: I previously answered this question as Choice A, describing two sides of a debate and using a general principle to resolve the conflict between them. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is Choice B, describing two sides of a debate and applying an economic principle to decide between them.

Explanation: The passage describes two sides of a debate in the legal community, with one side arguing that deliberate crimes are a product of societal norms and institutions, and the other side arguing that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. The passage then introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, to reconcile these two positions. This principle holds that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice, and that the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice B, as the passage describes two sides of a debate and applies an economic principle to decide between them.

This suggests that reality is not an objective, independent entity, but rather a subjective experience that is shaped by individual perspectives and experiences.

","  Reflection:

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realized that I made a mistake in selecting the correct answer. After re-reading the passage, I understand that the correct answer is (B) It reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.

The passage explains that in the 1930s, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. However, these calculations were not taken seriously by the physics community at the time, and researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen in the context of neutron bombardment of uranium.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible.

The passage suggests that law enforcement agencies have the power to effectively nullify particular laws or applications of law by declining to prosecute violators. This power is exercised frequently, and the passage explains why. One reason is that rules of law are overinclusive, meaning they forbid some conduct that the legislature did not want to forbid. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose heavy social costs. Therefore, law enforcement agencies use discretionary nonenforcement to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion (loopholes).

However, the passage also mentions that officials plan to target high-income neighborhoods to collect debts. This suggests that law enforcement agencies may not always enforce the law equally or according to the legislature's intent. In this case, option B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws, is the best answer.

","  Reflection:
After re-reading the passage, I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct answer is (E) The only reasonable solution to the problem of overdue water bills in the city is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes.

The passage suggests that the city is facing a problem of overdue water bills, with 231,000 customers late paying their bills, owing the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. The city officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. However, the passage also mentions that there is a loophole in the law that prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, which makes it difficult to collect the debts.

The only reasonable solution to this problem is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes. This would allow the city to attach liens to the property of delinquent water customers, just like other property-related creditors or tax authorities do. This would automatically make the money owed available whenever a property is sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice (C) as the best answer, but upon further reflection, I realize that choice (B) is the correct answer. The passage suggests that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes, which are not present in other alcoholic beverages. The passage states that ""studies show increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels,"" which suggests that the healthful effects of wine may be due to the unique composition of grapes. Choice (B) best supports this idea, as it suggests that subjects who drank wine and subjects who drank beer exhibited similar lipid levels in their bloodstreams, which suggests that the healthful effects of wine may be due to the specific compounds present in grapes rather than the alcohol content itself.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

Lichtenstein's work was characterized by a deliberate naivete and a faith in reconciliation between cartoons and fine art, as well as between parody and true feeling. Therefore, the example of pop art that is most in keeping with the spirit of Lichtenstein's work is option A, a painting that uses realistic techniques to represent several simple objects arranged on a table. This option aligns with Lichtenstein's use of comic-art conventions and his focus on depicting contemporary life in a realistic manner.

In contrast, options B and C are not in keeping with the spirit of Lichtenstein's work. Option B parodies human figures by depicting them as stick figures, which is not a characteristic of Lichtenstein's work.

Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (C) The demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model.

The passage suggests that literary agents will play a crucial role in the transition to the new digital model. The author notes that literary agents marketing new manuscripts will demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors, which will put pressure on traditional publishers to accommodate higher royalty payments. This implies that the demands of literary agents will be a driving force in the transition to the new digital model.

The other options do not accurately reflect the passage's content. Option (A) is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that changing literary tastes will be the main cause of the transition. Option (B) is also incorrect because the passage does not emphasize the ease of keeping books ""in print"" as the primary factor in the transition. Option (D) is incorrect because the passage does not mention the development of innovative marketing strategies as a key factor in the transition.

While Passage A presents a more optimistic view of fingerprint identification, Passage B acknowledges the limitations and uncertainties of the technique.

Passage B highlights the lack of objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches and the uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of two individuals sharing certain ridge characteristics. It also notes that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and that some proficiency tests have shown examiners making errors.

In contrast, Passage A presents a more definitive view of fingerprint identification, stating that it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and that experts have long concurred about its reliability. While it acknowledges that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent ""points and characteristics"" approach to identification, it does not address the limitations and uncertainties raised in Passage B.

","  Reflection:

Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (C) An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.

Explanation:
The utility maximization principle suggests that individuals will make decisions based on the expected utility of their actions. In this case, the industrialist is aware of the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, but the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine. Therefore, the industrialist will continue to illegally discharge the pollutant because the expected utility of this action is higher than the expected utility of complying with the law.

In contrast, the other options do not demonstrate a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

(A) The waiter's decision to conceal his tip income is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the risk of detection and penalty is too high. While the waiter may believe that the likelihood of detection is low, the potential penalty is significant, which outweighs the potential benefit of avoiding taxes.

(B) The motorist's decision to avoid speeding is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the cost of a speeding ticket is a significant deterrent. The motorist is aware of the potential penalty and adjusts her behavior accordingly.

(D) The government official's decision to solicit bribes is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the potential penalty is significant, and the official is aware of the legal and ethical implications of her actions. While the official may be motivated by financial need, this does not justify illegal behavior.

(E) The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because it is not a proportionate response to the perceived injustice. The worker's actions are driven by emotions rather than a rational assessment of the costs and benefits of his actions.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realized that I selected option A, ""arbitrary,"" as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I understand that the passage actually suggests that the test case strategy developed by Marshall was ""necessary"" (option D).

The passage explains that Marshall and the NAACP carefully crafted and coordinated their legal campaign against state-sanctioned racial segregation, including the use of test cases. The author notes that this approach involved selecting cases with sympathetic litigants and presenting expert testimony on the psychological impact of enforced segregation. The author also acknowledges that this tactic has been criticized by some legal scholars, but the passage does not suggest that the strategy was arbitrary or inflexible.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Necessary.

After re-reading the passage, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky would soften his attitude towards the radical critics' view if they were to draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy, put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects, or acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works.

Instead, the passage suggests that Dostoyevsky would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. The passage states, ""The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.

","  Reflection:

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realized that I selected option A, which is incorrect. The passage suggests that scientists should indeed attempt to study the possible healthful effects of moderate consumption of beer and distilled spirits, as well as other alcoholic beverages. The author highlights the assumption that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol, but notes that this assumption has obscured the potential health benefits of wine. Therefore, option A is not supported by the passage.

Moving on to the correct answer, option B is the most likely choice based on the information provided. The passage suggests that the conclusion that alcohol affects lipid processing should be questioned in light of studies of moderate wine consumption. The author notes that while alcohol has been shown to have negative physiological effects, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. This suggests that the effects of alcohol on lipid processing may be more complex than previously thought, and that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between alcohol and heart disease. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice.

After reevaluating the question, I realize that the correct answer is (C) preference for pursuing a series of cases that are to be tried in courts having a record of decisions that are favorable to environmental interests. This tactic is most closely analogous to the strategies that Marshall utilized during his work with the NAACP.

Like Marshall, environmental-advocacy public interest law firms often face the challenge of limited resources and a large number of potential cases. By focusing on a series of cases that are likely to be heard in courts with a track record of favorable decisions, these firms can maximize their chances of success and create a cascade of legal victories that can have a significant impact on the environment.

The other options do not accurately reflect the tactics used by Marshall or the modern-day environmental-advocacy public interest law firms. Option (A) is too narrowly focused on legal implications, while option (B) is too dependent on the personal popularity of the lawyers involved. Option (D) is too focused on the needs of the plaintiff, rather than the broader strategic goals of the campaign. Option (E) is a valuable research tool, but it is not the primary tactic used by these firms.

He believes that only fully realized artistic works can fulfill their goals, and that the ability to write well is the definition of artistry. The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky views literature as a means of addressing social issues and bringing about positive change, rather than simply serving as a means of expressing the author's thoughts or exploring the fantastic realm.

The passage actually affirms choice D, ""The structure of receptors on neuron surfaces plays a role in neuron communication.""

The passage explains that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions. Attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape, resulting in the opening of its channel component. This structure is consistent with the idea that the structure of receptors plays a role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question by selecting option C, ""Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

The correct answer is option E, ""Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture."" This answer is the strongest objection because it highlights the importance of adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied in order to achieve genuine understanding. The passage argues that attempting to understand non-Western cultures through Western scientific methods is distorting and maintains an Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. By adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied, one can gain a deeper and more accurate understanding of that culture.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realized that I made a mistake in selecting the correct answer. After re-reading the passage, I understand that digital publishing will not require the need for displaying books in retail stores (Option E). The passage states that ""the digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory,"" which means that there is no need to display printed books in retail stores.

The fourth paragraph does not describe tensions resulting from attempts to model two competing economic assumptions, but rather the difficulty associated with modeling an economic assumption (increasing returns) that is hard to represent mathematically.

","  Reflection:

After re-reading the passage, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect. The scenario described in the passage suggests that the cost savings from digital publishing will lead to higher royalty payments for authors, which will put pressure on traditional publishers to adapt. This means that option D, ""There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers,"" is unlikely to occur.

Instead, traditional publishers will need to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors. This could involve streamlining their operations, reducing their reliance on distributors and retailers, and investing in new technologies to improve efficiency.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, ""Most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers.""

I previously answered question B as (B) The author of passage B criticizes the type of argument made in passage A by attempting to create an analogous argument with a conclusion that is clearly false. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The author of passage B does not criticize the argument made in passage A, but rather presents an alternative perspective on the nature of altruistic behavior.

The correct answer is (A) The author of passage B seeks to support the main claims made in passage A by presenting additional arguments in support of those claims. The author of passage B acknowledges that the argument made in passage A is plausible, but seeks to provide additional evidence and reasoning to support it.

Explanation:
The author of passage B does not challenge the main claims made in passage A, but rather seeks to provide additional support for those claims. The author argues that the interest in propagating one's genes can explain altruistic behavior, but also acknowledges that there may be other interests that can explain such behavior as well. The author does not attempt to discredit the argument made in passage A, but rather seeks to provide additional evidence and reasoning to support it.

","  Reflection:

After re-reading the passage, I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. The passage suggests that the author would likely agree with statement C, ""The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.""

The passage explains that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice based on the principle of utility maximization. If the expected utility of lawful activities increases, the individual is less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. Therefore, increasing the access of individuals to economic institutions and rehabilitating those convicted of crimes can lead to a decrease in the rate of deliberate crimes.

On the other hand, statement A is not supported by the passage. The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that adopting laws requiring stronger punishments for repeat offenders would lead to a decrease in the rate of criminals returning to criminal activity.

Similarly, statement B is not supported by the passage. The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that ending efforts to rehabilitate criminals would lead to an increase in the rate of criminals returning to criminal activity.

Finally, statement E is not supported by the passage. The passage does not provide any information about the relationship between the level of law enforcement and the rate of deliberate crimes.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice (D) as the most consistent with the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not correct.

The passage suggests that identity in pre-contact Native American cultures was markedly inclusive and relational, extending beyond individual experiences to encompass the society, landscape, and cosmos. This means that the concept of identity was not fixed or static, but rather dynamic and interconnected.

Therefore, the most consistent answer is choice (C) - a similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities. This reflects the idea that identity in pre-contact Native American cultures was not defined by individual experiences alone, but also by the social and cultural context in which they lived.
