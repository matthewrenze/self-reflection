","Reflection:
I misread the question and did not pay enough attention to the details in the passage. I chose answer choice C, which is incorrect. The passage states that proponents of the second version of multicultural education argue that each culture should be taken on its own terms, but the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version are still identifiably Western. Critics of this version argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. Thus, the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved. Therefore, the answer to the question is answer choice C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.

The passage discusses the structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional style. The narrator's voice in Jazz is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. The central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak. The narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances.

Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is reliable and has an exceedingly low error rate. It cites the existence of uniform standards and testing requirements for fingerprint examiners. In contrast, Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match. It claims that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study. It also cites a more rigorous test that showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. Passage B is more tentative in its claims and less optimistic about the reliability of fingerprint identification than Passage A.

The passage also explains how Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed.

The author discusses the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption and how it differs from other alcoholic beverages. The author also mentions that wine has been thought to have healthful effects for centuries. The author also discusses the negative physiological effects of alcohol, but notes that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. The author also mentions that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. The author then discusses the possible reasons for these healthful effects, including increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound and increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. The author also notes that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness. The author does not mention anything about plums, apples, or other fruits. The author also does not make any statements about the healthful effects of beer or distilled spirits. The author mentions that one preliminary study linked the healthful effects to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red.

The author suggests that pre-contact Native American cultures had a markedly inclusive idea of self, which was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. The expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events, and autobiography was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. A decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments, would have been autobiographical. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
