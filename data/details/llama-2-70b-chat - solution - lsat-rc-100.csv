","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.

The passage suggests that proponents of the second version of multicultural education argue that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology, which are derived from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. Therefore, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first.

Given this information, it is likely that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. This is because the study would be using the same Western scientific methods that are criticized for being value-laden and Eurocentric.

The author of passage B calls evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory"" because it suggests that human behavior is driven by an unacknowledged interest in propagating genes. In passage A, the author explains that evolutionary psychology seeks to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution, and that altruism presents a difficult problem for this field. The author then suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother's instinct to help her injured child.

This explanation illustrates the author's point in passage B that evolutionary psychology imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of.

  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
","  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (D) The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.

The passage explains that the parable of the pin factory suggests that there are increasing returns to scale, meaning that larger businesses can produce more pins per worker than smaller businesses. However, this creates a natural tendency towards monopoly, as larger businesses can achieve lower costs than smaller businesses. The assumption of diminishing returns, which dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, assumes that returns to scale decrease as the size of the business increases. However, the Pin Factory example suggests that this is not always the case, and that there are industries where increasing returns to scale are a more accurate representation of reality.

Option (D) states that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This means that some industries may require a larger size than others to achieve increasing returns, which would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. If some industries require a larger size to achieve increasing returns, then it is not necessarily the case that larger businesses will dominate smaller businesses in every industry. This would weaken the argument that free markets always get it right, as the assumption of diminishing returns would not always hold true.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Reflection:

* I incorrectly answered the question the first time because I misunderstood the connection between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power. I mistakenly believed that the correct answer was (E) If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover. However, this option does not directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
* After reflecting on the problem, I realized that I needed to focus on the relationship between size and monopoly power, rather than the productivity of specialized workers.
* I also realized that I needed to consider the broader context of the passage, which discusses the Pin Factory example and the assumption of diminishing returns. This helped me to identify the correct answer, which is (D) The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.",,,E,0,1173,541,1714,

The passage explains how evolutionary psychology can help us understand altruistic behavior, which seems to be problematic for evolutionary theory since it diminishes the reproductive success of individuals that exhibit it. The passage suggests that the answer to this problem lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy, which were provoked by cues of kinship or familiarity in early humans. These experiences increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.

","  Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term ""proverb"" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, ""Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are."" Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you answer this question.

After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. I thought the question was asking about the origin of secondary substances in plants, but it's actually asking about the effects of secondary substances on plants.

The correct answer is E: A few of them act as regulators of plants' growth or metabolism.

The passage states that secondary substances in plants are not required for growth or metabolism, but they do have an impact on plants' chemical composition. The passage also mentions that some secondary substances act as defenses against insects, which suggests that they play a role in regulating plants' interactions with their environment.

Therefore, option E is the best answer.

I mistakenly thought that the question was asking for an example of a human characteristic that evolutionary psychologists propose a questionable explanation for, when in fact it was asking for an example of a human characteristic for which evolutionary psychologists propose a questionable explanation.

The correct answer is C: forming monogamous families. According to passage B, evolutionary psychologists propose that an interest in propagating genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly, and they argue that this applies to humans as well. However, the passage suggests that this explanation is not decisive and that there may be other interests that also explain the formation of monogamous families. Therefore, the explanation proposed by evolutionary psychologists for this characteristic is questionable.

The other options do not fit the criteria for a questionable explanation proposed by evolutionary psychologists. Option A, the early human tendency to live in small communities, is not discussed in passage B as an example of a questionable explanation. Option B, the slow maturation of human offspring, is mentioned as an example of an interest that would explain monogamous families, but it is not suggested to be a questionable explanation. Option D, misinterpreting the interests that motivate human actions, is not related to the topic of evolutionary psychology and its explanations for human behavior.

The passage provides information about the corrido, a type of narrative folk song, and its unique features, history, and cultural significance in the Lower Rio Grande Border region. The tone is informative, objective, and academic, and the content is focused on the musical genre rather than promotional or persuasive. Therefore, the passage is most likely from a book describing various North American folk song forms, which would provide a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the corrido tradition.

The other answer choices do not match the tone and content of the passage:

* A: A brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border would be promotional and focused on attracting visitors, rather than providing a detailed analysis of the corrido tradition.
* B: A study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain would be too specific and narrow in scope, and would not provide an overview of the corrido tradition.
* C: An editorial in a contemporary newspaper from the Lower Rio Grande Border would be too localized and focused on current events, rather than providing a historical and cultural analysis of the corrido.

The correct answer is (E) not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

Passage A suggests that law enforcement agencies have the power to decline to prosecute violators of the law, effectively nullifying particular laws or applications of law. This power is exercised frequently, and the passage explains why it is necessary to reduce the costs of overinclusive laws. However, the passage does not suggest that law enforcement agencies prioritize enforcement according to the amount of damage caused by crimes (choice C) or that they enforce the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible (choice A).

Nor does the passage suggest that law enforcement agencies always follow the legislature's intent in passing the laws (choice B).

The author refers to the centuries-old belief that wine has healthful effects to suggest that the scientific assumption that wine has no active ingredients besides alcohol might be mistaken. The author presents evidence that moderate wine consumption has healthful effects, which contradicts this assumption.

The author is not trying to demonstrate that discoveries in science often bear out popular beliefs (choice A), provide evidence for the theory that moderate wine consumption ameliorates factors that contribute to premature heart disease (choice B), argue that traditional beliefs are no less important than scientific evidence when investigating health matters (choice C), or refute the argument that science should take cues from popular beliefs (choice E).",,,D,0,1165,153,1318,

Based on my previous reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the question and focused on the wrong aspects of the passages. This time, I'll make sure to carefully read the question and the passages before answering.

The authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely disagree about the reliability and accuracy of fingerprint identification. Passage A states that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has been reliable, while Passage B argues that there are no objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches and that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.

Topic: Law
Context: The passage discusses the corrido, a type of narrative folk song that originated in the Lower Rio Grande Border region. The corrido has roots in eighteenth-century Spain and is characterized by its use of familiar conventions, such as ready-made lines and imagery, to tell stories that are specific to the Border region. The passage highlights the importance of the corrido in promoting cohesiveness in Border communities and notes that the songs are often used to commemorate significant local events.

Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?

Choices:

A: Corrido imagery is one of the clearest indicators of the unique cohesiveness of Border communities.

B: The roots of the corrido in the eighteenth-century Spanish ballad tradition are revealed in corridos' conventional themes and language.

D: Corridos are noted for their vivid use of imagery and their attention to local events.

E: The corrido is a type of folk song that promotes cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions.

Reflection:
In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option A. Upon reflection, I realized that while the passage does mention the importance of imagery in corridos, the main point of the passage is not focused solely on imagery. Instead, the passage highlights the role of corridos in promoting cohesiveness in Border communities and their unique use of familiar conventions. Therefore, the best answer is option E, which accurately summarizes the main point of the passage.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.

The critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. They emphasize that non-Western cultures often have value systems that are radically different from those of Western cultures, and that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

The other options do not accurately reflect the critics' objection. Option A is incorrect because the critics do not argue that members of a culture with different values cannot understand the social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values. Option B is incorrect because while the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values, this does not address the issue of whether it is possible to study another culture from more than one cultural perspective. Option D is incorrect because the critics do not argue that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.

","  I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Upon reflection, I realize that my answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. The correct answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.

The sentence at lines 7-11 presents the opinion of legal scholars who argue that defense lawyers should provide the best defense possible without judging their clients' guilt or innocence. The sentences at lines 28-31, on the other hand, present the author's view that defense lawyers should not present false assertions to the court and should only argue for leniency in sentencing if they sincerely believe it is warranted.

The relationship between these two sets of sentences is not one of opposition or disagreement, but rather a nuanced perspective that takes into account the ethical considerations of defense lawyers' roles. Both sets of sentences acknowledge the importance of defense lawyers providing a strong defense for their clients, but they also recognize that lawyers have an obligation to the court and society to act with integrity and honesty.

Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

","  After reflecting on the problem, my previous solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I misunderstood the question. The question asks for the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, not the most appropriate response.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

This response is not appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because it is motivated by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a careful calculation of the costs and benefits of the action. The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is unlikely to be influenced by economic considerations, such as the potential cost of legal penalties or the potential benefit of financial gain. Instead, it is driven by a desire to harm someone who the worker perceives has wronged them.

In contrast, the other options in the question are all motivated by economic considerations. Option A involves concealing income to reduce taxes, which is a rational response to economic incentives. Option B involves avoiding speeding to avoid a fine, which is also a rational response to economic incentives. Option C involves illegally discharging a pollutant because the cost of treatment is less than the fine, which is a rational response to economic incentives, although it is not a morally justifiable one. Option D involves soliciting bribes because the government salary is inadequate, which is also a rational response to economic incentives, although it is not a legal or ethical one.

","  Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though ""by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."" For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this ""underground river"" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.

Answer:  The reference to railroads (line 51) serves to 

B: illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor

Explanation:
The reference to railroads in the passage serves to illustrate the challenge of representing the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor. The passage states that railroads are an example of a business that exhibits increasing returns to scale, meaning that the bigger the railroad, the more efficient it becomes. However, representing this concept mathematically has been notoriously hard to do, which is why economists have struggled to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the reference to railroads in the passage highlights the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor.

The other choices do not accurately describe the function of the reference to railroads in the passage:

A: The reference to railroads does not resolve any ambiguity inherent in the metaphor of the Invisible Hand.

C: While the passage does mention that increasing returns characterize many enterprises, it does not specifically mention the increasing prevalence of industries that have characteristics of the Pin Factory.

D: The reference to railroads does not point to an industry that illustrates the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand. Instead, it highlights the challenge of representing the Pin Factory concept mathematically.

E: The passage does not present the example of railroads as an example of high levels of competition achieved in transportation industries. Instead, it uses railroads to illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor.

Based on the passage, the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work is one of admiration for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete. The author notes that Lichtenstein's work is not just a parody of comic books, but also a reflection of contemporary life. The author also highlights the ""inner sweetness"" of Lichtenstein's paintings, which suggests a sense of nostalgia and innocence. Therefore, the best answer is E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete.

Here's a breakdown of the other choices:

A: Enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects - The author does not express any enthusiasm for Lichtenstein's work in terms of its rebelliousness. Instead, the author focuses on the work's ability to convey a sense of realism and nostalgia.

B: Respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence - While the author does acknowledge that Lichtenstein's work is a parody of comic books, which are typically associated with youth and innocence, the author does not express respect for the work solely on the basis of its parody. Instead, the author highlights the work's ability to convey a sense of nostalgia and its subtle critique of contemporary culture.

C: Pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism - The author does not express any pleasure in Lichtenstein's work solely on the basis of its rejection of abstract expressionism. Instead, the author focuses on the work's ability to incorporate both realism and naivete.

D: Admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture - While the author does acknowledge that Lichtenstein's work contains a subtle critique of contemporary culture, this is not the primary focus of the author's admiration for the work.

The passage most strongly suggests that the author would agree with the following statement:

B: The corrido is unique among ballad forms because it uses language that is familiar mainly to local audiences.

The passage highlights the use of familiar images and linguistic conventions in corridos, which are specific to the Lower Rio Grande Border region. The author notes that corridos ""tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments"" and that figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare, instead incorporating everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. The author also emphasizes the importance of the despedida, which is a set convention that varies according to exigencies of rhyme, in marking the end of the ballad and asserting the maker's accomplishment in relating an authentic Border tale. These elements suggest that the corrido is unique among ballad forms in its use of language that is familiar mainly to local audiences, which is consistent with choice B.

","  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the passage and the question, I realize that my answer was incorrect.

Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. This is the correct answer, D.

The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that artistic merit was essential for a literary work to fulfill its goals. He defined artistry as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images that allow the reader to fully understand the author's thoughts. Dostoyevsky believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

The other options do not accurately reflect Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view. Option A is incorrect because Dostoyevsky did not believe that drawing a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy was necessary. Option B is also incorrect because Dostoyevsky did not believe that clarity of purpose should be prioritized over formal aspects when evaluating a literary work. Option C is incorrect because Dostoyevsky did not believe that eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works was necessary. Option E is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky may have wanted the radical critics to explain their demand that reality be depicted as it is, this is not the best answer given the context of the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.",,,D,0,1077,352,1429,

","  Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as ""literature"" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing has aspired to the condition of music, in which form contributes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as if with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.

5. Explain how the narrative strategy is analogous to Duke Ellington's style of musical composition.
6. Conclude by summarizing the main points and stating the correct answer.

Main theme:
The main theme of the passage is the literary device used by Toni Morrison in her novel Jazz, which is a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting her own linguistic virtuosity.

Literary device:
The literary device used in the passage is the use of jazz as a central metaphor in Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.

Analysis:
The use of jazz as a central metaphor in Jazz allows Morrison to explore the connections between music and literature, and to create a unique narrative strategy that is analogous to Duke Ellington's style of musical composition. The narrative slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice to the first-person lyricism of key characters, and throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. This literary device allows Morrison to create a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, which is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand that intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances.

Narrative strategy:
The unique narrative strategy used in Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is the use of a literary analogue of Duke Ellington's style of musical composition. Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting her own linguistic virtuosity.

Analogy to Duke Ellington's style:
The narrative strategy used in Jazz is analogous to Duke Ellington's style of musical composition, where he constructs his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as if with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the main theme of the passage is the literary device used by Toni Morrison in her novel Jazz, which is a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. The literary device used in the passage is the use of jazz as a central metaphor in Toni Morrison's novel Jazz. The unique narrative strategy used in Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is the use of a literary analogue of Duke Ellington's style of musical composition. Therefore, the correct answer is E: In Jazz, Morrison has succeeded in creating an original and effective narrative strategy that is a literary analogue of Duke Ellington's style of musical composition.",,,E,0,1324,1822,3146,

","  I apologize, but I am unable to answer the question as it contains redacted information. However, I can provide some guidance on how to approach the question.
The question asks about the author's discussion in the first paragraph of the passage, and the answer choices provide different ways in which the discussion could proceed. To answer the question, you need to carefully read the first paragraph of the passage and identify which of the answer choices best describes the author's approach.
In the first paragraph, the author makes a general remark about the relationship between literature and music, specifically noting that writing has aspired to the condition of music. The author then observes that this is particularly true in the African American tradition, where music is considered one of the greatest artistic achievements. Finally, the author mentions Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example of a work that uses music as a structuring principle.
Based on this analysis, the best answer choice would be B: from a general remark about two art forms, to a similar observation about a particular artistic tradition, to a specific comment about a particular work that exemplifies the prior remarks. This answer choice accurately describes the author's approach in the first paragraph, as they start with a general comment about literature and music, then focus on a particular artistic tradition (African American music), and finally mention a specific work (Jazz) that exemplifies the points made in the first two parts of the paragraph.

The passage states that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.

According to Dostoyevsky, ""artistic"" means that the novelist possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well.
Option B fits the definition of ""artistic"" writing as it describes a novel in which the author's ideas are given substance through suitable characters and events. This option aligns with Dostoyevsky's view that a work of art must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit"" and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.

The correct answer is B: effectiveness at communicating the author's ideas.

Dostoyevsky defines ""artistry"" as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images in a way that the reader can fully understand the author's thoughts. He argues that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit,"" and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work are secondary to its goal and purpose is a contradiction in terms. Therefore, the description of a work of literature as ""useful"" in the context of the passage refers to its effectiveness at communicating the author's ideas, rather than its ability to depict the fantastic, bring about social change, explode the boundaries of the tangible world, or advance a particular theory of literature.

","  I apologize, but I am unable to view the passage and question you provided. However, I can offer some general tips for answering questions about the organization of a passage.

When answering questions about the organization of a passage, it's important to identify the main purpose of the passage and the way the author presents information to achieve that purpose. Some common ways to organize a passage include:

1. Explanation of a theory and presentation of evidence in support of the theory.
2. Comparison of two or more theories and explanation of the strengths and weaknesses of each.
3. Description of a problem or obstacle and presentation of a solution or explanation that helps overcome the obstacle.
4. Explanation of a theory and description of how it came to win scientific acceptance.
5. Presentation of new information that challenges a theory and modification of the theory to accommodate the new information.

To answer questions about the organization of a passage, you can look for clues such as the main topic or focus of the passage, the author's tone and purpose, and the way the author presents information. You can also look for transitional phrases and words that indicate the author's train of thought and the flow of the passage.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

The passage argues that the second version of multicultural education, which adopts a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific methods to examine cultures, is problematic. The critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded on an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. Therefore, using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is distorting and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

Option E, genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, is the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. If genuine understanding is necessary for adequate appreciation, then adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, as proposed in the third version of multicultural education, is essential. This objection highlights the limitation of the second version of multicultural education, which relies on Western scientific methods that may not be suitable for understanding non-Western cultures.

Option A, it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, is not the strongest objection. While it may be challenging for outsiders to fully understand a culture, it is not impossible. Scholars and researchers can use various methods, such as participant observation, interviews, and historical research, to gain a deeper understanding of a culture.

Option B, many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another, is not relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. The passage focuses on the differences between Western and non-Western cultures, rather than the similarities among non-Western cultures.

Option C, some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, is also not relevant to the criticism. The passage argues that Western scientific methods are not suitable for understanding non-Western cultures, regardless of whether those cultures use their own value systems or not.

Option D, students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations, is not related to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. The passage discusses the limitations of Western scientific methods in understanding non-Western cultures, rather than the ability of Western students to understand their own culture's achievements.

Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instantaneous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories. Once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been designated ""out of print."" Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to justify investment in book printing machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expenses means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literary agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently, a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. Literary agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

Explanation:
The passage states that digital publishing will eliminate the need for warehousing printed books, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. However, it does not mention anything about eliminating the need for having book covers designed. Therefore, the correct answer is B: having book covers designed.

","  The main purpose of the fourth paragraph is to:

B: Explain a difficulty associated with modeling a particular economic assumption.

The fourth paragraph explains that the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns - the Pin Factory - are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough.

Therefore, the main purpose of the fourth paragraph is to explain the difficulty associated with modeling the economic assumption of increasing returns, which is represented by the Pin Factory, and how it has been a challenge for economists to represent this concept mathematically.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After re-reading the passage and reflecting on my previous answer, I realize that my initial response was incorrect.

The correct answer is E: The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly.

The passage states that with the shift to digital publishing, the need for physical inventory, warehousing, and shipping will be eliminated. This means that the demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly, as digital books do not require physical paper.

Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

  E: use of the holistic approach to fingerprint identification
","  During my initial attempt at answering this question, I mistakenly chose option A. After re-reading the passages, I realized that the correct answer is option C.
Passage A discusses the reliability of fingerprint identification and the lack of error rates revealing how often fingerprint examiners incorrectly identify a fingerprint as a particular person's. The passage mentions that there are no established error rates and that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. However, it also states that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability.
Passage B, on the other hand, discusses the lack of objective standards for evaluating whether two prints ""match."" It mentions that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and that local practices vary. The passage also states that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
Given this information, the correct answer is option C, differences in the identification practices used by various fingerprint examiners. Passage A mentions that there are no uniform, objective standards for fingerprint examiners, and passage B highlights the lack of consensus on a sufficient basis for identification and the variation in local practices. Therefore, option C is the best answer choice.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is option C: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

The passage suggests that the author would agree with this statement because it aligns with the economic principle of utility maximization. According to this principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime is based on a rational evaluation of the expected utility of the action. If the expected utility of lawful activities decreases, an individual is less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime.

Option A: The rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to fall if laws requiring stronger punishments for repeat offenders are adopted.

This statement is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the author would agree with this statement. While increasing penalties for crimes may deter some individuals from committing crimes, it does not address the underlying factors that lead to recidivism.

Option B: The rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to increase if efforts to rehabilitate them are ended.

This statement is incorrect because the passage suggests that rehabilitation can be an effective way to reduce recidivism. If efforts to rehabilitate criminals are ended, it is likely that the rate of recidivism will increase.

Option D: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to increase if the access of individuals to economic institutions decreases.

This statement is incorrect because the passage suggests that increasing access to economic institutions can reduce the rate of deliberate crimes. If access to economic institutions decreases, it is likely that the rate of deliberate crimes will increase.

Option E: The rate of deliberate crimes will tend to vary inversely with the level of law enforcement.

This statement is incorrect because the passage does not suggest a direct relationship between law enforcement and the rate of deliberate crimes. While effective law enforcement can deter some individuals from committing crimes, it does not address the underlying factors that lead to criminal behavior.

In conclusion, the correct answer is option C: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases. This answer aligns with the economic principle of utility maximization and is supported by the information presented in the passage.",,,C,0,1120,521,1641,

  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
","  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's try again.

The correct answer is option A: ""written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture.""

The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" refers to the collaborative process of creating written accounts of Native American life histories, which involved non-Native American collaborators working with Native American individuals to translate, record, and edit their stories. This process blended the cultural perspectives and experiences of both groups, resulting in a unique form of autobiography that reflects the cultural context in which it was created.

Option A accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase because it highlights the fact that the written accounts were based on the oral traditions and artifacts of Native American cultures, while still being written by members of another culture. This bicultural approach to autobiography is a key theme in the passage, and option A effectively captures its essence.

The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of the phrase. Option B implies a more equal collaboration between two individuals from different cultures, whereas option C suggests a more random or anonymous process of compilation. Option D implies that the writing was originally done by a member of one culture, but then edited and revised by a member of another culture, which is not necessarily the same as the collaborative process described in the passage. Option E is similar to option A, but it emphasizes the oral communication aspect rather than the cultural context in which the accounts were created.",,,E,0,1231,332,1563,

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem and the correct answer, I realize that I misunderstood the question and the concepts of identity in pre-contact Native American cultures.

The correct answer is B: A pictograph that represents a specific person incorporates the symbol for a constellation.

In pre-contact Native American cultures, identity was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. The incorporation of a symbol for a constellation in a pictograph representing a specific person reflects the interconnectedness of the individual to the natural world and the cosmos, which is consistent with the cultural perspectives of pre-contact Native American cultures.

Therefore, option B is the best answer.
