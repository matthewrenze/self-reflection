  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
","  Thank you for providing the reflection. Here's how I arrived at my answer:

The passage B author argues that evolutionary psychology is a ""conspiracy theory"" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of. The author uses the example of altruism to illustrate this point.

In passage A, the author explains that altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology because it is difficult to understand how an individual's expending energy or other valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual could have evolved. The author suggests that the answer lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy, which could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. These psychological experiences could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.

The passage B author argues that this explanation is a form of conspiracy theory because it implies that an individual's actions are motivated by an interest in promoting their own genes, even though the individual may not openly acknowledge or be aware of this interest. The author suggests that this is a common problem in evolutionary psychology, where interests are imputed to individuals based on their genetic makeup rather than their actual motivations.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish. This option best exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory.""",,,D,0,1269,395,1664,

","  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option B as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that option C is the correct answer.

The passage explains that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency towards monopoly power, as larger firms can achieve lower costs and drive smaller firms out of business. However, this does not necessarily mean that all industries with increasing returns to scale will result in monopoly power.

Option C suggests that when an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would. This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as collusion among firms can prevent them from exerting monopoly power.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

","  Great, let's break down the passage and analyze the answer to the question:

The passage presents three positions on the role of art in society:

1. The first position is that art stands high above the present and the everyday.
2. The second position is that art has a right to exist only if it finds its sources in concrete reality and contributes to the creation of a new society.
3. The third position is Dostoyevsky's realist position, which recognizes that reality is shaped by the person experiencing it, and that art must explore the boundaries of the so-called real world.

The passage differentiates the third position from the first two by providing more detail on Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and his rejection of the radical critics' demand that art serve a particular political view.

Therefore, the best answer is option B: ""Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.""

The passage does not present a hierarchy of the three positions, but rather presents each position in detail, highlighting their differences and similarities. Option A is not accurate, as the passage does not present three positions in detail, but rather presents one position (Dostoyevsky's) in detail, while briefly mentioning the other two positions. Option C is also not accurate, as the passage does not present the third position as inferior to the second. Option D is not accurate, as the passage does not present the third position as superior to the first two. Option E is not accurate, as the passage does not present a comparison between the three positions.

I also realized that answer choice (C) improved the physical health of individuals who exhibited the behaviors is not supported by the passage. While it is possible that certain behaviors may have improved the physical health of individuals, the passage does not suggest that this was a primary driver of their evolution.

Answer choice (D) made individuals who exhibited the behaviors more adept at finding food is also not supported by the passage. While it is possible that certain behaviors may have provided individuals with an advantage in finding food, the passage does not suggest that this was a primary driver of their evolution.

Finally, answer choice (E) prompted early humans to live in mutually dependent groups is not supported by the passage.

","  Reflection:

Upon reviewing the passages, I realized that the correct answer is (E) Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable.

The first passage highlights that while fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has withstood the test of time. The court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has been reliable for so long. However, the passage also acknowledges that there are no established error rates for fingerprint identification, and examiners lack uniform, objective standards.

The second passage, on the other hand, emphasizes the lack of objective standards for evaluating whether two prints ""match."" While some examiners use a ""point-counting"" method, there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. The passage also notes that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and some proficiency tests have shown a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.

Therefore, the principle that underlies the arguments in both passages is the importance of objective standards in ensuring the reliability of fingerprint identification. Fingerprint examiners must follow consistent and objective standards to avoid errors and ensure that fingerprint evidence is reliable.

The passage discusses the mechanism by which neurotransmitters transmit electrical impulses between neurons. The main point of the passage is that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The passage explains that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions, and that attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component.

Choice (D) most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that option B is the best choice. The passage highlights how Marshall's work with the NAACP developed innovative strategies that have become standard tactics for public interest lawyers. The author explains that Marshall and the NAACP carefully crafted their legal campaign, selecting cases with sympathetic litigants and using sociological and psychological statistics to persuade courts to strike down discriminatory laws. These strategies have been widely adopted by public interest law firms in the US, and have been used in various political campaigns, including consumer advocacy and politically conservative efforts to change the law through litigation.

The relevant evidence refers to the data that was present but lacking the right conceptual link. This can be seen in the passage when Meitner recognizes the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. The evidence was present in the experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, but the connection to nuclear fission was not made until Meitner and Frisch submitted their paper. Therefore, the most nearly equivalent to ""the relevant evidence"" is option D, the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand why. I selected option A, ""a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border,"" because I misinterpreted the passage's tone and content. The passage does not provide information that would be useful or relevant to tourists visiting the region. Instead, it provides a detailed analysis of the corrido tradition, including its historical and cultural significance, its unique features, and its use of metaphors and standard generic elements.

Upon further reflection, I realized that the passage is most likely drawn from option E, ""a book describing various North American folk song forms."" The passage provides detailed information about the corrido tradition, including its origins in the Lower Rio Grande Border region and its significance in affirming the cohesiveness of Border communities. The passage also highlights the unique features of the corrido, such as its use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions, its heavy reliance on metaphors, and its use of standard generic elements. These details suggest that the passage is about the Lower Rio Grande Border region and the corrido tradition specific to that area, rather than a brochure for tourists, a study on the ballad's influence on Spanish music, an editorial on contemporary issues, or a book on North American folk song forms.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option (A) ""to start eating something else instead."" Upon further reflection, I realized that the passage does not mention this option as a way in which insects can adapt when a plant develops defenses against them.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) ""to pollinate other species of plants."" This is mentioned in the passage as a way in which insects can adapt when a plant develops defenses against them.

Explanation:
The passage mentions several ways in which insects can adapt when a plant develops defenses against them. One of these ways is to evolve a way to circumvent the plants' defenses, which is mentioned in option (D) ""to pollinate other species of plants.""

The passage explains that insects may evolve a way to circumvent the defenses of a plant by pollinating other species of plants. This allows the insects to continue to obtain nutrients from the plants without being harmed by their defenses.

In contrast, options (A) and (C) are not mentioned in the passage as ways in which insects can adapt when a plant develops defenses against them. Option (B) ""to avoid plants with certain distinctive leaf or flower structures"" is mentioned in the passage as a way in which insects may avoid plants with defenses, but not as a way in which they can adapt to defenses that have already developed.

The correct answer is (D) Most of the residences with outstanding water bills are in the city's high-income neighborhoods.

The passage suggests that the city's current method of collecting water debts, which involves selectively cutting off the water of high-income residents, is not a viable solution. This is because the law prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and therefore, attaching a lien to the property is not an option. The passage also implies that changing the law would be easier and politically smarter than continuing to use the current method.

Now, let's look at the options:

B: He prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.

The passage does not provide any information to suggest that Ellington prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos. In fact, the passage highlights Ellington's ability to construct his compositions with individual musicians in mind, allowing them to improvise within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. This suggests that Ellington was not opposed to lengthy solos or improvisations, but rather, he had a deliberate approach to composition that allowed for both individual expression and collective unity.

Instead, the second version of multicultural education seeks to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.

The passage suggests that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the natural compounds found in grapes, which are not present in other alcoholic beverages. The study mentioned in the passage found that individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice had decreased platelet adhesiveness, which may be the first step in confirming the speculation that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes. Therefore, if a study were to show that subjects who drank grape juice exhibited greater platelet adhesiveness than did subjects who drank no grape juice, this would provide further evidence to support the passage's position that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the natural compounds found in grapes.",,C,A,0,1583,189,1772,

","  Action: Answer(""E"")

The passage highlights Lichtenstein's use of comic-art conventions and his faith in reconciliation between cartoons and fine art, suggesting that he was interested in commenting on contemporary life and culture through his work. Option (E) best aligns with this focus on consumer culture, as it involves using vague shapes and images to make a statement about society's values.

The passage also describes Lichtenstein's work as a deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication in the art world. This implies that his work is not overly complex or pretentious, but rather straightforward and direct. Option (E) reflects this quality of simplicity and directness, as it does not rely on complex symbolism or hidden meanings.

Finally, the passage highlights Lichtenstein's faith in reconciliation between parody and true feeling. Option (E) does not rely on a straightforward parody of consumer culture, but rather employs vague shapes and images to make a statement about society's values. This approach allows for a reconciliation between the comic-book reference point and the fine art medium, which is in line with Lichtenstein's faith in reconciliation.

In conclusion, option (E) is the best answer because it aligns with the passage's description of Lichtenstein's work and best captures the spirit of his art. It reflects his focus on commenting on contemporary life and culture, his use of comic-art conventions, and his faith in reconciliation between parody and true feeling.",,E,E,1,1562,359,1921,

The author notes that once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog, which eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing, which would likely lead to the acceptance of the new digital model. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: The demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model.

Passage B differs from passage A in that passage B is more tentative in its claims. While passage A presents a more optimistic view of fingerprint identification, passage B acknowledges the limitations and uncertainties of the technique. It highlights the lack of objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches and the uncertainty surrounding the error rate of fingerprint identification in actual practice. Therefore, the best answer is (C) tentative in its claims.

In passage A, the author presents a more positive view of fingerprint identification, stating that it has ""so ably withstood the test of time."" The author also notes that while further testing and development of standards may be desirable, there is no reason to reject fingerprint identification outright. This language suggests a more confident and optimistic tone.

In contrast, passage B takes a more cautious approach, acknowledging the limitations of fingerprint identification. The author notes that there are no objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches and that the error rate of fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. This language suggests a more tentative and uncertain tone.

  E: Near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies.
","  Great, let's break down the answer:

The passage suggests that the author would agree with statement D, ""The invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press.""

The author argues that technology has a democratizing influence by making it more accessible to a wider range of people, leading to a narrowing of the gap in benefits accruing to different groups. The passage specifically highlights the expansion of access to printed texts and personal computing power as examples of this democratizing influence.

Therefore, the author would likely agree that the invention of the telephone, which has made communication more accessible to a wider range of people, has had a greater democratizing influence on society than the invention of the printing press, which initially made written materials more accessible to a smaller group of people.

So, the correct answer is (D) The invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press.

I previously answered question 5 incorrectly, selecting option A as the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. However, upon further reflection, I realize that option E is the correct answer.

The explanation in the passage suggests that the utility maximization principle can be applied to understand why individuals make certain choices, including criminal behavior. According to this principle, individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility. In the case of option E, the worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This action may seem irrational at first glance, but from a rational choice perspective, it can be seen as a response to the perceived injustice.

The worker may believe that the only way to address the perceived injustice is through violent means, as the legal and social institutions that are meant to provide redress may be ineffective or biased. In this sense, the worker's action can be seen as a rational response to the economic incentives and disincentives present in the situation.

Therefore, option E is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as it involves a non-rational response to a perceived injustice rather than a purely economic decision-making process.",,,E,0,1252,309,1561,

The passage mentions the defendant challenging the fingerprint evidence used against them at trial, which is a common tactic used by defense attorneys in appeals of criminal convictions. The author highlights the lack of established error rates for fingerprint identification and the inconsistency of fingerprint examiners in evaluating matches, which are both common arguments made by defense attorneys in challenging the reliability of forensic evidence.

The author's use of language and tone also suggests a more advocatory approach, which is typical of defense attorneys. The author presents the defendant's challenge to the fingerprint evidence in a way that emphasizes the weaknesses in the prosecution's case, rather than simply accepting the evidence at face value.

Overall, the passage suggests that the author is a defense attorney arguing an appeal of a client's criminal conviction, rather than a judge, prosecutor, or academic presenting a paper to a group of legal scholars.

","  Reflection:

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting choice (C) apprehension about the possibility of its misuse. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the author's attitude towards the discovery presented in the last paragraph is best described as (B) optimism about its potential applications.

The passage highlights the significance of the discovery, stating that it raises the possibility of highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders, and that pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons. This suggests that the author is optimistic about the potential benefits of the discovery.

In contrast, choice (C) apprehension about the possibility of its misuse does not accurately reflect the author's attitude towards the discovery. While it is true that the author acknowledges the possibility of misuse, the passage does not convey a sense of apprehension or concern about this possibility.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option B as the main point of the passage. However, upon closer reading and reflection, I realize that option C most accurately states the main point of the passage. The passage highlights the disagreement between proponents of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding, with one proposal advocating for a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures, while the other proposal emphasizes the importance of understanding cultures on their own terms. The passage argues that the second proposal is problematic because it still reflects the values of the Western scientific perspective, which may not be the most appropriate lens for understanding non-Western cultures.

My previous answer was incorrect because I misread the passage and focused on the wrong aspect of the argument. I mistakenly thought that the passage was discussing the importance of recognizing the subjective, intuitive, and mystical aspects of cultures, when in fact it was highlighting the limitations of Western scientific methods in understanding non-Western cultures.

Option C describes a similar approach, where the environmental-advocacy public interest law firm prefers to pursue a series of cases that are to be tried in courts having a record of decisions that are favorable to environmental interests. This approach allows for the careful selection of cases that are most likely to be successful, much like Marshall's selection of sympathetic litigants.

You then reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer, which helped you to correctly answer the question this time.

To answer the question, we can analyze the passage and identify the main idea or purpose of the text. The passage provides information about the organization of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which are important for transmitting chemical signals in the brain. The text explains how these channels work, including the binding of neurotransmitters to receptors and the resulting opening of ion channels. The passage also discusses the implications of this discovery, including the potential for selective treatment of brain disorders.

Based on this analysis, the best description of the organization of the passage is:

B: explanation of a theory; presentation of evidence in support of the theory; explanation of an alternative theory; presentation of information to support the alternative theory; discussion of an experiment that can help determine which theory is correct.

The passage provides an explanation of the theory of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, presents evidence in support of this theory, and explains an alternative theory (the role of receptors in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity). The passage also presents information to support the alternative theory and discusses an experiment that can help determine which theory is correct.

  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
","  Great, let's analyze the passage and the question together:

The passage describes how physicists were initially unaware of the significance of the data obtained through neutron bombardment of uranium, despite the fact that they had been collecting evidence for some time. The breakthrough came when Lise Meitner recognized the connection between the data and underlying theoretical considerations.

The question asks which of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

Now, let's apply the information from the passage to the question:

Option A is incorrect because the physicists conducting the experiments were not using the same research techniques. In fact, the passage states that ""a common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse."" This suggests that the physicists had different expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.

Option B is also incorrect because the physicists conducting the experiments did have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. As the passage states, ""a common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse."" This expectation was based on the understanding of nuclear physics at the time, which did not anticipate the possibility of nuclear fission.

Option C is correct. The passage states that the physicists conducting the experiments had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms. This lack of awareness delayed the recognition of the significance of the data.

Option D is incorrect because more physicists concentrating on combining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium would not have reduced the amount of time it took to realize that atoms were being split.

Option E is also incorrect because the passage does not mention any experiments conducted on other substances.

Therefore, the best answer is (C) The physicists conducting the experiments had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms. This lack of awareness delayed the recognition of the significance of the data.",,,B,0,1275,506,1781,

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A as the best answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the author of passage A would be most likely to agree with option B: At least the plan would have a lower social cost than would turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time.

The author of passage A is concerned with the overinclusive nature of laws and the costs associated with enforcing them to the letter. In passage B, the plan to selectively cut off water to high-income neighborhoods is presented as a way to collect debts without imposing too great a burden on the city's resources. The author would likely agree that this plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules, as it allows the city to collect debts without punishing innocent residents.

Option A, which suggests delaying the plan until after the legislature's annual appropriations hearing, is not the best answer because it does not address the underlying issue of overinclusive laws. Option C, which suggests that the plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter, is also not the best answer, as it does not take into account the social costs of enforcing overinclusive laws.

  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
","  Reflection:

Upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.

The passage suggests that the second version of multicultural education is criticized for prioritizing Western scientific methods of examination and understanding, which are seen as value-laden and Eurocentric. The objection argues that genuine understanding of other cultures can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, rather than imposing Western scientific methods.

Option (C) best supports this objection. It suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values, which aligns with the idea of adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. This approach recognizes the diversity of value systems across cultures and avoids the Eurocentric bias of the second version of multicultural education.

While options (A) and (B) touch on the idea of cultural perspectives and methods, they do not specifically address the issue of Eurocentric bias in the second version of multicultural education. Option (D) is not relevant to the passage, as it does not discuss the importance of understanding another culture's achievements. Option (E) is also not the best answer, as it simply restates the main idea of the passage without providing a specific counterargument.",,,A,0,1179,315,1494,

","  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I had misunderstood the passage. The correct answer is (D) There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers.

The passage suggests that with the shift towards digital publishing, the cost savings and efficiency gains will lead to a decrease in the demand for traditional publishing services such as copy editing and book design. This is because digital publishing allows for more automation and streamlining of the publishing process, which reduces the need for these services.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

(A) The need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books is not supported by the passage. While it is true that the demand for paper and binding material may increase, the passage does not suggest that the need for warehousing will shift in this way.

(B) The patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention used book stores or suggest that their patronage will increase.

(C) Most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers is not supported by the passage. While the passage does suggest that digital publishing will make traditional publishing less expensive and more efficient, it does not suggest that publishers will start selling their own books directly to consumers.

(E) The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly is not supported by the passage. While it is true that the demand for paper may decrease with the shift towards digital publishing, the passage does not suggest that this will happen significantly.

","  Reflection:

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option (A) as the best answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

The passage suggests that the author's perspective on crime deterrence is rooted in the economic principle of utility maximization. According to this principle, individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility. Therefore, if the expected utility of lawful activities increases, individuals are less likely to commit deliberate crimes. On the other hand, if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases, individuals are more likely to commit deliberate crimes.

In light of this analysis, option (C) is the best answer. It aligns with the author's perspective on crime deterrence and the economic principle of utility maximization. Options (A), (B), and (D) do not accurately reflect the author's viewpoint.

  D: A name given to one member of a community cannot be given to another member of the same community.
  E: A decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe.
","  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (C) A similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities.

The author suggests that in pre-contact Native American cultures, identity was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. The expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events, with the participation of fellow tribal members, and included songs, chants, stories, and dance. The author also notes that a tribe would contribute to the individual's narrative actively by joining in the expression of that narrative.

Option C aligns with these ideas as it states that a similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities, which is consistent with the author's description of the cultural constructs of highly diverse Native American peoples. In pre-contact Native American cultures, the process of assuming a new name was not unique to an individual but was a common practice among many communities, suggesting a shared understanding of identity that was relational and communal.

The other options do not align as well with the author's ideas:

Option A is incorrect because in pre-contact Native American cultures, a person who is born into one tribe but is brought up by members of another tribe did not necessarily retain a name given at birth. While there may have been some consistency in naming practices across tribes, there is no evidence to suggest that a person's name was tied to their birth tribe in the way suggested in Option A.

Option B is incorrect because while pictographs may have represented specific people or events, they did not necessarily incorporate the symbol for a constellation. The author does not provide any evidence to suggest that pictographs were used in this way.

Option D is incorrect because in pre-contact Native American cultures, a name given to one member of a community could be given to another member of the same community. While there may have been some consistency in naming practices across tribes, there is no evidence to suggest that a name given to one member of a community could not be given to another member of the same community.

Option E is incorrect because while decorated shields may have been used in some Native American cultures as a means of recording important events and deeds, they did not necessarily incorporate the symbol for a particular tribe. The author does not provide any evidence to suggest that decorated shields were used in this way.

Overall, Option C is the best answer as it aligns most closely with the author's ideas about identity in pre-contact Native American cultures.",,,B,0,1711,565,2276,
