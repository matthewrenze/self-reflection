Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5. 
If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. 
If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 6 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. 
In either case, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 is completely determined.
