Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The bay holding fuel is next to the bay holding machinery.
  B: The bay holding grain is next to the bay holding machinery.
  C: The bay holding livestock is next to the bay holding fuel.
  D: The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.
  E: The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding fuel.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
- The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
- There are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
- There are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
- We need to find the statement that cannot be true based on the given information.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
If the bay holding livestock is next to the bay holding fuel, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 1 or 2. However, the bay holding grain must be higher than the bay holding livestock, which means the bay holding grain must be bay 3 or higher. This contradicts the statement that the bay holding livestock is bay 1 or 2. Therefore, statement C must be false.
