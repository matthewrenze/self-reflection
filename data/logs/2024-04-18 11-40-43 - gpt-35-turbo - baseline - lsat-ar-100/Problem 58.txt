Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Bay 4 is adjacent to the bay holding textiles.
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
Therefore, the bay holding livestock must be in bay 5 or 6.
The bay holding textiles must be in bay 3 or 5.
If bay 3 holds textiles, then bay 4 holds produce.
If bay 5 holds textiles, then bay 4 holds livestock.
Therefore, machinery or grain cannot be held in bay 4.
