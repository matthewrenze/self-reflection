Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the given conditions, we know that:
1. Grain is held in a bay with a higher number than Livestock.
2. Livestock is held in a bay with a higher number than Textiles.
3. Produce is held in a bay with a higher number than Fuel.
4. Textiles is next to Produce.
From these conditions, we can infer that Textiles cannot be in the highest-numbered bay (6), because Livestock and Grain must be in higher-numbered bays than Textiles. Similarly, Livestock cannot be in bay 6 because Grain must be in a higher-numbered bay. Therefore, Grain could be in bay 6, and Livestock could be in bay 5. 
Since Textiles must be next to Produce, and Produce must be in a higher-numbered bay than Fuel, the lowest possible bay for Produce is bay 3 (with Fuel in bay 2 and Textiles in bay 4). 
Therefore, the only cargo that cannot be in bay 4 is Livestock, because it must be in a higher-numbered bay than Textiles, which could be in bay 4.
Action: Answer("B")
