Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, and that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that there must be at least one day where two batches of cookies are made. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day, this means that there must be at least one day before Thursday where two batches of cookies are made. Therefore, it is not possible for only one batch of cookies to be made on Friday, making statement [REDACTED] the correct answer.
