Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.

The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. So, livestock cannot be in bay 6. 
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So, textiles cannot be in bay 6 or 5.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So, fuel cannot be in bay 6 or 5.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. So, textiles and produce must be in bays 2 and 3, but it is not clear which one is in which bay.
From the above deductions, we can conclude that machinery must be in bay 1.
Action: Answer("E")
