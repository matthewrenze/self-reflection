## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. This means that the bay holding textiles must be numbered lower than 4. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, but it is also next to the bay holding textiles, so it cannot be in bay 4 either. Therefore, the type of cargo that cannot be held in bay 4 is textiles or produce.
Action: Answer("D")
