Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: It can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that the author would agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: The profits derived from computer technology have accrued to fewer people than have the profits derived from any other technological development.
  B: Often the desire of some people for profits motivates changes that are beneficial for large numbers of other people.
  C: National boundaries are rarely barriers to the democratizing spread of technology.
  D: Typically, investment in technology is riskier than many other sorts of investment.
  E: Greater geographical mobility of populations has contributed to the profits of entrepreneurs and investors in technology.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
The passage suggests that the market system has a democratizing effect on technology, making it accessible to a wider range of people over time. The author notes that while profits from technological developments may initially accrue to a small group of people, the drive to expand markets and lower prices leads to increased accessibility for a larger share of the population. Therefore, option B, "Often the desire of some people for profits motivates changes that are beneficial for large numbers of other people," aligns with the author's perspective.

The other options do not accurately reflect the author's views:

A: The passage does not mention anything about the distribution of profits from computer technology compared to other technological developments.

C: While the passage mentions that technology can extend beyond national boundaries, it does not explicitly state that national boundaries are not barriers to the democratizing spread of technology.

D: The passage does not discuss the riskiness of investing in technology compared to other investments.

E: The passage does not mention how greater geographical mobility of populations affects the profits of entrepreneurs and investors in technology.
