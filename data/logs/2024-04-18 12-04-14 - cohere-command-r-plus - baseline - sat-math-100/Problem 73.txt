Question: The sum of three numbers is 855 . One of the numbers, $x$, is $50 \%$ more than the sum of the other two numbers. What is the value of $x$ ?
Choices:
  A: 570
  B: 513
  C: 214
  D: 155
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the sum of the other two numbers be $y$. Then, $x = \frac{3}{2}y$.
We also know that $x + y = 855$. 
Substituting $x = \frac{3}{2}y$ into this equation gives:
$\frac{3}{2}y + y = 855$
Combining like terms gives:
$5y = 855$
$y = 171$
Substituting this value back into $x = \frac{3}{2}y$, we get:
$x = \frac{3}{2} \times 171 = \mathbf{513}$
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
