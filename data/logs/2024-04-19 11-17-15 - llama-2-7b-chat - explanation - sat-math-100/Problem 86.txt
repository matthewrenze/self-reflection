## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If $y=k x$, where $k$ is a constant, and $y=24$ when $x=6$, what is the value of $y$ when $x=5$ ?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 23
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I correctly set up the equation $y = kx$ and substituted $x = [REDACTED]$ to get $y = 12$. However, I then made an error in my calculation by assuming that the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ would be the same as when $x = [REDACTED]$.

The correct solution is:

If $y = kx$ and $y = 24$ when $x = [REDACTED]$, then we can set up the equation:

$$y = kx$$

Substituting $x = 5$, we get:

$$y = k(5)$$

Which gives us:

$$y = 10$$

So, the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ is $10$.
