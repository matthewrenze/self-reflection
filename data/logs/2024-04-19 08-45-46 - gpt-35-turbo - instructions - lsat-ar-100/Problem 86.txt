Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Reflection:

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
3. Use logic to deduce the possible solutions.
4. Check each solution against the constraints.
5. Choose the solution that satisfies all the constraints.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. This means the bay holding fuel must be bay 6 and the bay holding machinery must be bay 4. However, this violates the constraint that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be bay 5. This means the bay holding livestock must be bay 4 and the bay holding machinery must be bay 2. The bay holding grain must be bay 1 and the bay holding fuel must be bay 6. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are completely determined.
