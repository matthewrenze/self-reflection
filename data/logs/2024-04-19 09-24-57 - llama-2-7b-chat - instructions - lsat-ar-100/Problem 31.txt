Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

* I misunderstood the condition that states "At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday." I thought it meant that at least one batch of each kind of cookie had to be made on Monday, but it actually means that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
* I also misunderstood the condition that states "The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies." I thought it meant that the second batch of oatmeal cookies had to be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, but it actually means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

Based on my self-reflection, I will now answer the question correctly. The complete and accurate list of days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made is:

* oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday
* peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
* sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday

Action: Answer("B")
