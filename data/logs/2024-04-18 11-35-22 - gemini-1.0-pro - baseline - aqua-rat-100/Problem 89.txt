Question: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
Choices:
  A: 11.75 miles
  B: 12.75 miles
  C: 17.75 miles
  D: 14.75 miles
  E: 10.75 miles
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, which is the minimum charge.
The remaining amount for travel is $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.
Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, which is $0.10.
The number of additional quarter-miles that can be traveled with $5 is $5/$0.10 = 50.
The total distance traveled is the first quarter-mile plus the additional 50 quarter-miles, which is 1 + 50 = 51 quarter-miles.
Since each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, the total distance traveled is 51 x 0.25 = 12.75 miles.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
