Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I forgot to consider the fact that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, if bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. The bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The bay holding fuel must be bay 6. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 is completely determined. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Logical error
 - Forgetting a constraint
Solution:
If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. The bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The bay holding fuel must be bay 6. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 is completely determined. 
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
3. Use logic to deduce the possible solutions.
4. Check each solution against the constraints.
5. Choose the solution that satisfies all the constraints.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
 - Use logic to deduce the possible solutions.
 - Check each solution against the constraints.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
