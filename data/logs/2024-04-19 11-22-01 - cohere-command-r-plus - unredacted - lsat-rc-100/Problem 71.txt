Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: It can be inferred that the author of passage B would regard which one of the following as a mistaken assumption underlying arguments like that made in passage A?
Choices:
  A: Most of the physical features characteristic of modern humans developed as the result of evolutionary pressures.
  B: Any action performed by an early human was necessarily orchestrated by that individual's genes to promote the genes' self-propagation.
  C: To explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans.
  D: Evolutionary psychology can be used to explain human behavior but not animal behavior, since animal behavior is driven largely by instinct.
  E: Most early human behaviors that significantly hindered reproductive success were eliminated by evolutionary competition.

Explanation: I misinterpreted the author's criticism of evolutionary psychology and the concept of genetic self-propagation. I focused on the idea that individuals may not be aware of or acknowledge the role of their genes, but I missed the key point about the potential for multiple interests and motives to explain behaviors. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Omission
- Overlooking context

Solution: The author of Passage B criticizes the assumption that evolutionary psychology makes, which is to explain human behavior solely from the perspective of genetic self-propagation. They argue that this reduces complex human behavior to a single motive, ignoring the possibility of multiple interests and motives. 

Passage A makes the argument that altruistic behavior can be explained by evolutionary psychology, suggesting that it contributes to the propagation of genes for identification and empathy. However, the author of Passage B would see this as an oversimplification. They would argue that altruism could be motivated by other factors, such as an inherent interest in the welfare of others, and that it is rare for a single interest to decisively explain a behavior. 

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

**Choice C**: "To explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans." 

This choice captures the mistaken assumption that Passage B criticizes, which is the simplistic application of evolutionary theory to explain complex human behavior. 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the context: Grasp the arguments presented in both passages, focusing on the critique of evolutionary psychology in Passage B. 
2. Identify the critique: Recognize that the author of Passage B challenges the idea that evolutionary psychology reduces complex behavior to a single motive. 
3. Evaluate the choices: Assess each answer choice against the critique presented in Passage B. 
4. Contextualize the choices: Consider how each choice relates to the arguments and counterarguments presented in the passages. 
5. Select the answer: Choose the option that best reflects the mistaken assumption that the author of Passage B is likely to challenge. 

Advice: 
 - Understand the context and nuances of the passages. 
 - Recognize and address potential biases or oversimplifications in the arguments. 
 - Consider counterarguments and alternative explanations. 
 - Evaluate answer choices critically, ensuring they align with the specific critique presented. 
 - Remember that the correct answer should reflect the author's perspective and address their concerns.
