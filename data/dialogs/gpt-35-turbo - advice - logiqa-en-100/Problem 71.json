This seems contradictory. Therefore, we need to find a statement that can reasonably explain this phenomenon.\nOption A talks about the type of work that college students will do as a nanny, but it does not explain why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.\nOption B talks about the salary that people are willing to pay, but it does not explain why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.\nOption C explains that people think doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, but it does not explain why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.\nOption D talks about the belief that students should choose a field related to their major in practice, but it does not explain why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them.\nTherefore, Option C is the best explanation for the seemingly contradictory phenomenon because it explains why people favor college students as nanny but do not want to hire them. People think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, but they do not think that college students can provide better housekeeping services. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
