I misunderstood the problem and calculated the number of faces of the smaller cubes incorrectly.\n\nError Keywords: Misunderstanding the problem, Calculation error, Counting error\n\nSolution:\nTo calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted, we need to first calculate the volume of the hollow cube. The volume of the hollow cube is 5cm x 5cm x 1cm = 25 cm³.\nSince the cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube is 25 cm³ / 1 cm³ = 25.\nThe outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 25 - 6 (faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted) = 19.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 19.\n\nAdvice: Always read the question carefully and understand the problem. Decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps. Think through each subproblem step-by-step. Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning. Always double-check your calculations and final answer. Remember that the number of faces of a cube is 6, regardless of its size."
