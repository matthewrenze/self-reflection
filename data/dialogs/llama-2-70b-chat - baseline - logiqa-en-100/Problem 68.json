This is stated in the premise \"If he only lived one day, it would be best for him to steal other people's things because he would not suffer the fear of being caught.\" The argument assumes that the person knows that they will only live for one day and therefore will not suffer the consequences of being caught.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the argument does not assume that anyone who steals things from others will not live for a few days.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the argument does not assume that worrying about being caught will not cause pain to people.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the argument does not assume that a person who knows that they cannot live for a few days will usually choose to do something good instead of something bad."
