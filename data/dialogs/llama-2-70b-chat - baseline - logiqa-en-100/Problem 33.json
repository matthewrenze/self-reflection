The inconsistency can be resolved by choice C, which states that two entrepreneurs are Chinese, and another American is a lawyer. This means that there are at least 3 Chinese people on board (the two entrepreneurs and one of the lawyers), which would increase the total number of people on the helicopter beyond 9. Therefore, choice C provides a supplement that can explain the inconsistency."
