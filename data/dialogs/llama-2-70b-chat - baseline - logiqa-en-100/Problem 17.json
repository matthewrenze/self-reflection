However, choice B reveals that there are additional costs associated with maintaining the aluminum alloy armored vehicles, which were not considered in the initial statement. This additional cost could potentially offset the financial benefits of using aluminum alloy armored vehicles, and therefore, raise doubts about the conclusion."
