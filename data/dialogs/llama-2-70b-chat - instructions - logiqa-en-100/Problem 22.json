However, upon further consideration, I realized that option A does not actually explain the gap between the statistics and people's feelings. The fact that the CPI statistical range and standards were formulated over 20 years ago may affect the accuracy of the data, but it does not explain why people's personal experiences differ from the moderate increase indicated by the CPI.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: China's current CPI statistical range and standards were formulated more than 20 years ago, and it is difficult to truly reflect the current trend of consumer prices.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
