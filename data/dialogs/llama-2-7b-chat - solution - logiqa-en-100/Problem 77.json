Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.\n\nThe members of the printing group and the binding group are mainly from the following seven employees: F, G, H, J, K, L, and M. The conditions for each group are as follows:\n\n1. Each group has at least 3 employees.\n2. F and K cannot be in the same group.\n3. If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.\n4. M is at least one of the members of these two groups.\n5. At least one of the same employees in both groups.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the printing group has only three members (G, H, and L), and under sufficient conditions, the two groups have as many common members as possible, then we must find the correct statement that must be true.\n\nBased on the given conditions, we can conclude that:\n\n1. The binding group and the printing group cannot have a common member. (Reason: If K is in the binding group, J must also be in the binding group, but J is not a member of the printing group, so they cannot be common members.)\n2. The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common. (Reason: G, H, and L are the only members of both groups.)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common."
