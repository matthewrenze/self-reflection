However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not the correct one.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) One of the functions of personal income tax is to regulate social distribution and narrow the gap between rich and poor. This is because the official's argument is based on the idea that low-income earners should be honored as taxpayers, but the starting point for personal income tax should not be too high. This implies that the tax system should be designed to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality, which is one of the primary functions of personal income tax.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) One of the functions of personal income tax is to regulate social distribution and narrow the gap between rich and poor."
