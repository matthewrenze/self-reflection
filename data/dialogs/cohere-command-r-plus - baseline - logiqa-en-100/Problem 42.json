This directly contradicts the argument's timeline, as the Neolithic Age ended around 2,000 BCE, which is less than 5,000 years ago. If the entrance collapsed earlier, the artifacts could have accumulated after the cave was no longer inhabited, or they could have been placed there by people who accessed the cave through other means.\n\nTherefore, Choice D is the best option to refute the argument.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
