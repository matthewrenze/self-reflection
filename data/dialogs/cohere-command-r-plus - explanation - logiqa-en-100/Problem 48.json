A better choice would have been to suggest that the increase in US real estate purchases by wealthy Chinese individuals could be attributed to factors other than wealth transfer. This perspective considers alternative causes for the observed phenomenon and does not rely on the specific percentage increase, which may fluctuate over time.\n\nThought: \nThe correct answer should reflect a perspective that offers a different interpretation of the data or presents a counterargument that weakens the original argument.\n\nAnswer C provides such a perspective by acknowledging the presence of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese individuals. This group could be responsible for a significant portion of the transactions, aiming for short-term profits rather than wealth transfer.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
