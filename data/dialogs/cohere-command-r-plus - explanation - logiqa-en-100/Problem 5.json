Answer choice B does this by presenting an alternative perspective: that free speech can disrupt social order, which is necessary for meeting the needs of the masses. This choice directly contradicts the argument's conclusion without undermining its premise.\n\nThe other choices may weaken a related argument, but they do not directly address the link between free speech and meeting the needs of the people through the government.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
