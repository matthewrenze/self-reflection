Any car equipped with airbags may experience a car accident.\n  B: Ignore this possibility? Owners without airbags pay more attention to driving cautiously.\n  C: Improper assumption? In any car accident, the airbag will automatically open.\n  D: Improperly equate the possibility of a car accident with the seriousness of the car owner ’s injury in the accident.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the loophole in the argument. \nThe argument assumes that installing an airbag in a car does not make the car owner safer because the proportion of cars with airbags in car accidents is higher than that of cars without airbags. However, this argument ignores the possibility that the severity of injuries in accidents involving cars with airbags is lower than that of cars without airbags.\n"
