F speaks in either the first or third place. \n3. J is the fourth speaker, which means J is the first speaker after lunch.\n4. Only one speaker is between M and N. This means that if M is the third speaker, N must be the fifth speaker, or if N is the third speaker, M must be the fifth speaker.\n5. Since J is the fourth speaker, and only one speaker is between M and N, the third speaker must be either M or N.\nTherefore, if J is the fourth speaker, the third speaker must be M or N.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
