The human resources department and sales department are not on adjacent floors (given in condition 1).\n4. Looking at the answer choices, only choice C has the planning department on the bottom floor, followed by the finance department, which matches conditions 1 and 2.\n5. In choice C, the administrative department is above the finance department (and thus also above the planning department) but below the human resources department, which matches condition 3.\n6. Also in choice C, the human resources department and sales department are separated by the R&D department, so they are not adjacent, which matches condition 1.\nTherefore, choice C matches all the given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
