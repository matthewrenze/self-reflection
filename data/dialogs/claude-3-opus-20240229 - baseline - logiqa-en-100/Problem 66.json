This means that F must be directly north of H.\n3. I and E are adjacent, but we don't know which one is north of the other.\n4. Given the information in (1), (2), and (3), there are two possible arrangements:\n   Arrangement 1: G - F - H - I - E\n   Arrangement 2: G - F - H - E - I\n5. There are no other possible arrangements that satisfy all the given conditions.\nTherefore, there are 2 possible arrangements for this group of islands.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
