Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n2. Pay attention to the keywords in the question, such as \"best.\"\n3. Identify the main idea or argument being presented.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice and determine which one best supports the main idea or argument.\n5. Choose the answer that directly supports the main idea or argument.\n"
