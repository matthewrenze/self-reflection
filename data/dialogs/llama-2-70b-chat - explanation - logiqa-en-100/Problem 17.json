After reevaluating the question, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (B): After the introduction of aluminum alloy armored vehicles, the army must retain maintenance personnel and purchase new tools and parts.\n\nThis choice raises doubts about the conclusion that it is not advisable to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy armored vehicles. The fact that the army must retain maintenance personnel and purchase new tools and parts suggests that there are additional costs associated with maintaining and repairing aluminum alloy armored vehicles. These costs may offset the financial benefits of using lighter and more expensive aluminum alloy armored vehicles.\n\nMy previous answer, (A): After the aluminum alloy armored vehicle is put into use, the running cost is one-third of the steel armored vehicle with the same performance, does not directly address the maintenance and repair costs associated with aluminum alloy armored vehicles. While the running cost may be lower, the maintenance and repair costs may be higher, which could negate the financial benefits of using aluminum alloy armored vehicles.\n\nTherefore, choice (B) is the best answer, as it highlights a potential flaw in the conclusion that aluminum alloy armored vehicles are not advisable from a financial point of view."
