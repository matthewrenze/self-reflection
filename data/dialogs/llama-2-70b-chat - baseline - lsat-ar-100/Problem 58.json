The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?\nChoices:\n  A: grain\n  B: livestock\n  C: machinery\n  D: produce\n  E: textiles\n"

Grain\n6. Machinery\n\nFrom the given conditions, we know that:\n\n* The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain must be in bays 5 or 6.\n* The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so livestock must be in bays 4 or 5.\n* The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so produce must be in bays 3 or 4.\n* The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles must be in bay 2.\n\nGiven these constraints, the only type of cargo that cannot be in bay 4 is machinery (choice C). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
